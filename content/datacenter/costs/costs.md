# Costs

A high-power, dependable datacenter constructed using traditional designs can incur a substantial cost of over $15 million per megawatt.

Consider a scenario where the design targets a modest 50 kW per rack for future-proofing, and we plan for 200 racks. Such a setup would require a 10-megawatt power capacity. The financial implication of this is significant â€“ constructing a datacenter of merely 500 square meters under these parameters would entail an investment of around $150 million.

Operating a 10-megawatt load using a diesel generator would translate to a daily expense of approximately $140,400. When projected over a year, the power costs alone would escalate to an unsustainable $51 million, casting serious doubts on the economic feasibility of such an operation.
