## Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

In times of conflict, datacenters emerge as primary targets. This was evident in scenarios like Ukraine, where just 4-5 significant datacenters became crucial points of vulnerability, leading to catastrophic outcomes when compromised. Beyond the threat of physical attacks, these centers are also susceptible to cyber-attacks and insider threats. Relying on centralized data storage and processing facilities poses a considerable risk to a nation's or an organization's critical digital assets.

The necessity for datacenters, especially for high-end computing tasks, is undeniable. However, their role in storage can be re-evaluated, and many computing functions can be effectively managed through alternative approaches. Distributed computing strategies, for instance, can mitigate some of these risks.

Implementing a network of smaller, strategically located datacenters across a country is a prudent step. Ideally, having at least 10 such facilities dispersed in key locations can enhance resilience. This approach not only diversifies the risk but also aids in efficient data distribution and management. A distributed network like this can maintain functionality even if some nodes are compromised, ensuring continuous operation and data integrity in challenging times.

We believe in a hybrid approach.

The strategy of combining larger datacenters with a network of smaller, distributed ones offers a complementary approach that leverages the strengths of both models while mitigating their respective weaknesses. This hybrid approach balances the need for high-power computing capabilities, redundancy, security, and efficient data management.

### Advantages of Larger Datacenters

1. **High-End Computing Capabilities**: Larger datacenters are better equipped to handle high-density computing tasks, especially those requiring extensive processing power like AI and machine learning workloads.
2. **Economies of Scale**: They can offer cost efficiencies in terms of energy, maintenance, and staffing due to their size and scale.
3. **Advanced Infrastructure**: Bigger datacenters often have the financial and technical resources to invest in cutting-edge technologies, security systems, and specialized staff.

### Advantages of Smaller, Distributed Datacenters

1. **Resilience to Localized Failures**: In case of physical or cyber-attacks, natural disasters, or power outages, having multiple datacenters ensures that the impact on the overall network is minimized.
2. **Reduced Latency**: Smaller datacenters located closer to end-users can significantly reduce data transmission times, improving response times for local users.
3. **Flexibility and Scalability**: They can be quickly adapted or scaled according to regional demands or technological changes.
4. **Enhanced Security Posture**: A decentralized network makes it more challenging for attackers since compromising one site does not yield control over the entire network.

### Complementary Approach: Balancing Both Models

- **Strategic Placement**: Larger datacenters can be established in major economic or tech hubs where high-density computing is most needed. Smaller datacenters can be distributed in less centralized areas to provide local services and back-up.
- **Load Distribution**: Critical, high-intensity tasks can be managed by larger centers, while decentralized nodes handle local data processing and storage, thus distributing the workload effectively.
- **Enhanced Continuity and Redundancy**: The larger datacenters can act as central hubs for backup and disaster recovery for the smaller centers, ensuring continuous operation across the network.
- **Synergy in Operations**: The smaller datacenters can act as edge nodes, preprocessing data for the larger centers, reducing bandwidth needs, and improving overall efficiency.

In summary, employing both larger and smaller datacenters in a complementary manner provides a balanced, robust, and flexible infrastructure. This hybrid approach not only enhances operational efficiency and data processing capabilities but also significantly improves resilience and security across the network.
