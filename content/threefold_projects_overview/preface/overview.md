# Overview of some big projects (confidential)

As TFTech we are on our way to be cash flow positive before the end of the year because of following projects:



* INCA, neighborhood clouds (first 5m USD project closed, more projects underway)
* Sales of TFT (through liquidity pool and deployment of TF Validators), we use our treasury for this but we want to do this as little as possible, because the TFT value will grow tremendously over the next few years.

Next to our default income we are working on some big projects.  Below we describe in more detail to allow you to assess the relation between our effort spent and potential benefit for the planet, people and of course ourselves.  

These are some of the projects we work on:



* Tanzania full blown Internet deployment (first proposal made for 6m users)
* Mauritius triple bank project (we deliver the backend tech - proposal is 5m USD and monthly fee later)
* Mauritius Fiber Network (500.000 users)
* Bangladesh bank project (we deliver the backend tech - proposal will be 5m USD and monthly fee later)
* Zanzibar Digital Freezone & Banking Project (full colab with government & president)
* US Native tribes, full blown internet deployment, first validators have been sold and money did arrive.
* Algorand/Nax, a super credible blockchain we hope to close a partnership with
