# NAX/Algorand

* New Asset eXchange (NAX) - NAX is a digital asset creation platform that transforms corporate assets into kinetic liquidity through the development of new asset-backed ventures and securities. They have amassed tremendous support from major global corporations, including Axa Insurance and are becoming a major player in alternative digital assets with partnerships between Algorand, Skybridge and many prominent industry leaders. We are currently exploring with NAX the potential to add ThreeFold as part of their core strategy to achieve a more scalable and secure New Asset Exchange platform built on ThreeFolds layer zero. 
* Algorand is in our personal opinion one of the most exciting projects in the blockchain space, working together with them and NAX could catapult us from a marketing, partnership and valuation perspective.
* What do we bring to the table:
    * Reach to millions of users on their Blockchain.
    * Core 0 layer. 
    * Web 4 layer.
    * Alternative to Dfinity for their own use cases.
* What do they bring to the table:
    * Extremely strong partners with** a lot of credibility**, this should result in lots of awareness for ThreeFold in the market.
    * Blockchain technology platform for some of the projects we are working on.
    * Potentially funding or access to funding through their friends
    * Regulatory adoption through their existing channels within the US and EU.
