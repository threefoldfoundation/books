# Zanzibar Sovereign Internet, Digital Freezone,  Digital Banking Licenses & Issuing Platform



* Zanzibar Government (with full support of the President and all relevant ministers and government instances) want to roll out ThreeFold Internet in Zanzibar with focus on digital backbone, economic inclusion, education, â€¦ as well as backend system for a new Digital Freezone which also has capability to issue banking licenses and supporting technology platform.
* Target market: 
    * 45 million digital nomads (main focus), resolve their tax & banking situation
    * 1.6m people in Zanzibar
* Next steps:
    * Very strong MOU has been signed !!! Probability is high but we need to resolve funding model.
    * **ThreeFold needs to execute on feasibility study &lt; end summer, Kristof/Chris & our partners.**
    * A signing ceremony and launching event is being planned (mid oct), together with President launch all, will give serious credibility and market reach
* What do we need to deliver: our decentralized internet, knowledge around how to create a country wide internet based on ThreeFold concepts & technologies, Digital Banking platform (same as Mauritius, Bangladesh)
* How will we do it: we have a team on ground now, there is no funding for it yet, we get funding from Kristof and some friends to get started. ThreeFold only supports about 10k per month. \
Kristof and some of our young team members moved to Zanzibar, thanks to a friend we have access to a boutique hotel and 10 apartments to operate from and build out our initial presence. Cost is less than 1200 USD per person per month for housing & food, which makes it an ideal location to attract more talent and centralize some of our operations on 1 location where we can also service Tanzania from.
* Why do we care
    * Planet/People: a more sustainable, fair, safe internet for all Zanzibar citizens and 45 million digital nomads with all capabilities as we can deliver together with our partners. We get full freedom from the government. Zanzibar gives us the sandbox in which we can demonstrate everything.
    * Partner/Profit: 2.5-5m USD at start. Together with partners we deliver digital banking & blockchain backend as well on a country scale.
