# US Native Tribes

Following a successful event held earlier this year in Dubai focussed on serving the under underserved communities with many various stakeholders present, a specific project is manifesting to build a sovereign internet infrastructure for the American Native tribe. What is accounting to a consortium of partners working together to bring an all inclusive sovereign internet solution to the amricannative tribal communities, including infrastructure, towers, telecommunications, social impact solutions, all underpinned by Threefold technology.

Target Market: Empowering the american native tribal communities across 547 tribes including nearly 10 million people

**Next Steps: **



* finalizing the core entities responsible for the various elements of technology and financing of the initial pilot project
* Executing the MOU defining the roles of all parties and scope of the pilot project
* Key meeting happening end July which will determine federal funding of this project beyond the pilot phase
* Confirm financing for Pilot project and execute

**What do we need to deliver:** The entire solution is hinged on Threefold given the main objective being ensuring the sovereignty of the american native tribes in the internet economy. To this end, ThreeFold need to deliver our software stack powering the physical infrastructure grid itself

**How will we do it:** a well considered consortium of partners, lead by Threefold, including partners focused on infrastructure, operations, applications, financing etc will jointly define the scope of the pilot project and agree clear roles and responsibilities in executing this critical initial phase. The collective strength of this team of partners and combined experience will ensure a successful pilot and ensure a continued rollout to the extended native american communities

**Why do we care**: This project aligns 100% with the purpose of Threefold and we have a significant opportunity to show how our technology ensures absolute sovereignty and brings true impact and socio economic upliftment to previously disadvantaged communities
