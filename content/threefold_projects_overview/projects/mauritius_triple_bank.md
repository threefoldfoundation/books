* Why do we care
    * Planet/People: a real opportunity to create a better (safe, regulated, whitelisted, cost effective) global financial system with all elements neatly integrated. There are almost no jurisdictions left where with government support a real whitelisted and strongly regulated env can be created with all elements of the financial world integrated in most efficient and user friendly way. Our aim is to help create a global fair system with equal chances for everyone in the world with also a strong connection to Africa.
    * Partners/Profit: + 5 million USD at start, and TBD license fees later \
An incredible opportunity for blockchain and other partners to regulated and resolve their financial/banking/regulatory issues
