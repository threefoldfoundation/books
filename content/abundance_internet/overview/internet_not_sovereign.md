## The Internet Is Not Sovereign

We want to help countries, many countries find themselves in a challenging situation where they  have too much debt, people are potentially unhappy, there could be a risk of conflict, ...

We believe a new upgraded internet may help because:

- A large part of the world's population uses Internet services which are produced far away.
- The  value of a digital life can be thousands of USD per year, this gets extracted from a countries GDP
- Data is stored outside your country leading to loss of influence and knowledge.
- Less job opportunities because local Internet economy is way smaller than what it can be

We believe a decentralized Internet of Internets could help. Some very concrete benefits for a country to get started now.
