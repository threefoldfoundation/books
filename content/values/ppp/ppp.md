We believe in:

* **Planet First**  
* **People Second**  
* **Profit As Result**  


Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.

Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.

We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. 

Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:

* abundance based
* unlimited knowledge
* glocal communication and collaboration
* exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries.
