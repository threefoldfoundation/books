# Zero Knowledge Proof Storage system.

The quantum save storage system is zero knowledge proof compliant. The storage system is made up / split into 2 components:  The actual storage devices use to store the data (ZDB's) and the Quantum Safe Storage engine.

The zero proof knowledge compliancy comes from the fact the all the physical storage nodes (3nodes) can proof that they store a valid part of what data the quantum safe storage engine (QSSE) has stored on multiple independent devices.  The QSSE can validate that all the QSSE storage devices have a valid part of the original information.  The storage devices however have no idea what the original stored data is as they only have a part (description) of the origina data and have no access to the original data part or the complete origal data objects.
