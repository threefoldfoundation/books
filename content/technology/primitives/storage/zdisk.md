# ZOS_Disk

Virtual disk creates the possibility to create and use virtual disks which can be attached to containers (and virtual machines).  

The technology is designed to be redundant without having to do anything.

## Roadmap

- The virtual disk technology is  available for OEM's only, contact ThreeFold Tech.
