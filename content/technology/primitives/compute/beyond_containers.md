## Beyond Containers

![](img/container_native.jpg)


Default features:

- compatible with Docker
- compatible with any Linux workload

We have following unique advantages:

- no need to work with images, we work with our unique zos_fs
- every container runs in a dedicated virtual machine providing more security
- the containers talk to each other over a private network: zos_net
- the containers can use web_gw to allow users on the internet connect to the applications as running in their secure containers 
- can use core-x to manage the workload
