All technology is developed by ThreeFold and is opensource, this technology is being used for the ThreeFold grid see https://www.threefold.io which is a deployment of a new internet which is green, safe and owned by all of us.

This document explains how we are a missing layer for the full web2, web3 and blockchain world.

This leads to a system which is highly scalable.
