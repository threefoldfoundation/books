# The World Needs an Internet of Internets

![](img/internet_of_internets.png)

To create an upgraded abundance-based internet system we need to provide following three pillars:


* a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold
* an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) 
* a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance-based world

Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch; an internet which would deliver all the needs for a better future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.

In each OurWorld Internet, abundance is the foundation:

* lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …
* All applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free
* You can find everything for free, you can promote anything for free.
* You can freely exchange anything for anything else (money for goods, goods for goods, money for money, …)
* There is no need for interest, lending money can be organized differently.

This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.

## The Internet of Internets integrated DEFI.

Each Regional Internet hosts and connects to its own set of blockchains and web4 and banking4 functions, which interact with global public blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Casper Labs, Cosmos, Stellar, Algorand and all the rest...

Each Regional Internet is responsible for their

* Identity & reputation management of the members of their community.
* DEFI blockchain with links to any other possible blockchain as required.
* DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization 

Each Regional Internet hosts a capable decentralized financial system (DEFI) which operates on multiple levels:

This Ourworld DEFI system is unique because it allows the integration of any other local or global blockchain token in such a way that the token is usable from within the OurWorld Instance even if for whatever reason connection with the global network would be broken. As an additional benefit, using the external token with OurWorld would go faster and would not need the extreme energy needed for tokens like Bitcoin (today 100USD worth of energy per transaction).

The DEFI system is also the liquidity pool and treasury (initial funding) for each OurWorld Internet.


## The Internet of Internets is Reliable

Each Regional Internet is ultra reliable:


* Data can never be lost nor corrupted.
* Internet lines can be cut, even if all public Internet connections would go down, the local instance would still function, allowing financial transactions to happen and information to be consulted as the data is local and safe.
* The distributed nature of the Internet of Internets is even war-safe, a disaster or war situation has no impact on the reliability of the internet (if a large enough distribution is achieved)
* All systems are local and sovereign.

Because it's an effort by the people for the people it has, by design, more support and so it can grow without limits.  


## The Internet of Internets is OpenSource

All components inside the system are open source and all of the code and knowledge required is delivered as part of the local deployment. As a result, every community can contribute to and co-create our future.

It's a platform created by all of us for everyone. There is a 100% decentralized code management system integrated to allow this to happen.


## The Internet of Internets is Complete

There are tens of incredible experiences ready to go. \
The Following Experiences are deployed in each OurWorld Instance:

* Sikana (education system with lots of content, +4billion views today)
* Uhuru (alternative to Office 365 or Google Docs/Drive)
* Alternative to twitter, whatsapp, facebook, … 
* The resources and materials needed to deploy such an internet (manuals, ebooks and videos)
* Full set of information
    * We are executing on a huge effort to download and categorize +40 Petabytes of information from the existing internet, this information will be available in each OurWorld Instance. We will make sure that all this information is protected and available to everyone in the world independent of what is happening or what will happen.
    * It's an endless stream of information (maps, educational content, source code, knowledge, ebooks, …).


## Countries do need their own Internet !

On the security side, the Internet is super centralized today and actually very vulnerable. The Cyber Pandemic is a reality.
