## **Goal 3: Realizing Web 4 for a better world.**

There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.

**_”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”_**

Much of the current Cloud & Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. 

To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.

It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …)


The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet

Benevolent projects need:

* A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.

* A financial (funding & exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.

* An application and development platform which allows them to build their "experience" in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).

* A storage system where all data & information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.

* An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.

* A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.

* A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.
