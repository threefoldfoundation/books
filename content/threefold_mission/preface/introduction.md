# Threefold Mission

# ![image alt text](preface/img/sky_surfing.png)

**"When you were born in a world where you don’t fit in, you were born to help create a new one."**

Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets:
* An Internet of Internets is owned by the people.
* It interconnects us all, directly, without anyone in the middle.
* We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.
* On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.
* Not to control. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.
* Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.
* A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.
* As believers in a better world who choose to act.

**_"The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world."_**

We can continue down the path we’re on.  
But ask yourself, is it a good one? Is it the right one? Is it just?  
Is the world we live in today the one we wish for our children and all those to come?  

If yes, please continue.  
If not, we have an answer.  

Come on, come all. Creators. Builders. Dreamers. No need to dream anymore.

This is the Internet of Internets.  
It’s for you. For me. For all of us.  
By you. By me. By all of us.  

So, are you with us? Then come along.  
Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.
