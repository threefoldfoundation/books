# Vesting Overview

Vesting is a voluntary mechanism introduced by ThreeFold in march 2021. It allows any ThreeFold token holder to put their tokens in a vesting pool on voluntary basis.

The tokens will gradually unlock over 48 months and there is an acceleration forseen if the price of the tokens goes up well.

> DISCLAIMER: This is a voluntary process. Each peron who choses to vest their tokens understands that this will get their tokens locked up.
