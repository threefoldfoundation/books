# Buy TFT through Stellar

Stellar has a built-in exchange = Stellar_Exchange

You can use this exchange to go from a Stellar token e.g. XLM to TFT or other way around.

## Step One: Use an Exchange to Buy XLM with Fiat

Fiat is the name for euros, dollars, or other government-issued currencies. 

A fiat gateway allows you to enter the world of digital currencies through depositing fiat currency.

- You can choose any digital currency exchance (Kraken, Binance,...) to go from Fiat to a digital currency like XLM.
- Example [manual for coinbase to buy digital currencies](coinbase_fiat).
- [Exchanges recommended by Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/exchanges)

Next, you'll want to add funds to your wallet and exchange those funds for XLM. Those XLM can later be exchanged for TFT on the decentralized exchange.

## Step Two: Convert XLM to TFT

This part of the process involves:

1. Installing or use a new wallet that can be used to store XLM and buy TFT, or use a web based wallet
2. Setting up a trustline for TFT (means teach the wallet about the existence of ThreeFold Token)
3. Exchanging XLM for TFT

## 4 Different Ways How the Stellar Exchange Can Be Used
