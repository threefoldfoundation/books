Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain network built for running smart contract-based applications. BSC runs in parallel with Binance's native Binance Chain (BC), which allows users to get the best of both worlds: the high transaction capacity of BC and the smart contract functionality of BSC.

### Advantages

- Lots of liquidity
- Automatic price governance, thanks to DEFI technology like [Pancake Swap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)
- Low transaction fees
- Fast
