# Use Coinbase to Buy XLM with 

If you need help purchasing cryptocurrency in order to get to TFT, this section is for you. We decided to use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) as an example, as Coinbase is a well-known and reputable public exchange that has a gateway from fiat to digital currencies. If you prefer [another exchange](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/exchanges), please feel free to do so. Just do your research!

## Sign up for Coinbase

First, you'll need to sign up for an account with Coinbase. Head to the [Get Started (Sign Up)](https://www.coinbase.com/signup) page and follow the process there. You will need a government-issued photo ID, a functioning email address, a mobile device, and a payment method. Available payment methods differ based on your region. The process is quite straight-forward but we've included some links at the bottom of this page directly from Coinbase if you need support.

## Navigate the dashboard

Once you've logged into Coinbase, you'll land in the dashboard. Here you can manage the details of your account as well as buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Since we're really only focused here on buying cryptocurrency in order to get to TFT, we won't dive into all of the dashboard. Again, Coinbase has plenty of [excellent resources](https://help.coinbase.com/en) if you need them!

## Exchange your fiat for digital currency.

Now you're ready to buy any digital currency supported by Coinbase. In this scenario, we recommend XLM which is Stellar's native token. We recommend XLM because it can be traded directly with TFT.

On coinbase.com:

1. Sign in to Coinbase.
2. Select Buy / Sell on the upper right-hand side.
3. Click the Buy panel to select the asset you'd like to purchase (choose XLM)
4. Enter the amount you'd like to buy denominated in your local currency.
5. Select your payment method.
6. Click Preview Buy to confirm your purchase (you can always click the back arrow to make a change).
7. If the details are correct, click Buy to complete your purchase.

On the mobile app:

1. Tap + Buy on the Home tab.
2. Select the asset youâ€™d like to buy (choose XLM)
3. Enter the amount you'd like to buy denominated in your local currency.
4. Select Preview Buy to review your purchase (you can always tap the back button to make a change).
5. If all the details are correct, tap Buy now to complete your purchase.

Congratulations! You now have XLM in your wallet and you are ready to buy ThreeFold_Tokens!
