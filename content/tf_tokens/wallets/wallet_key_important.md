## Important Instructions To Secure Your Wallet

- Always use a password to secure your account on a wallet (any wallet).
- Remember your secret key and store on secure location. Losing this secret key might result in the loss of your account and the funds in it. 
- No party in the world can reset or retrieve the secret key and neither can be held responsible for losing funds at any time. 
- We highly recommend writing the key down rather than storing digitally.
