# Set up TFT on Metamask

- Download Metamask [here](https://metamask.io/download.html). Then, install the Metamask extension in your local browser.
- Create a Metamask account
- Switch the network to `Binance chain`. You will have to create a new network with following information):
  - Mainnet
  - Network Name: Smart Chain
  - New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
  - ChainID: 56
  - Symbol: BNB
  - Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com

- Add TFT token in Metamask -> custom token -> contract address = ```0x8f0FB159380176D324542b3a7933F0C2Fd0c2bbf```
  
Once this configuration is done, your TFT wallet is ready.
