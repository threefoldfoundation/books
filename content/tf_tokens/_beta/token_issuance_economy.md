# ThreeFold_Token

ThreeFold_Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, and application) on the ThreeFold_Grid.

The ThreeFold_Token represents a unit of reservation of autonomous Internet capacity.

Internet capacity is the world's fastest growing commodity, and the TFT is supported by this highly demanded, underlying economy of infrastructure and services called ThreeFold. Threefold is comprised of developers, farmers, and users from all over the world.

### Where to get TFTs

ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) can be bought from any of the ThreeFold Farmers, active digital currency exchanges or through users on our own native decentralized exchange (DEX). For more information please visit [threefold.io](https://www.threefold.io)

### Utility Driven

“Utility” driven means that ThreeFold_Tokens can be used to buy and sell the internet capacity and/or products and services on the ThreeFold_Grid. In this way, the token’s value is supported by the economy of services.

The community will have access to all metrics of the ThreeFold_Grid required to determine its economic value.

### Economic Value

The ThreeFold_Token value will be determined by market supply and demand, however, the underlying economic value (internet infrastructure) that supports the token economy has been designed to always be far greater than tokens issued, to ensure there is tangible infrastructure deployed with the generation of each token.

Given the nature of the issuance model, the number of tokens issued by the grid to new farmers is always smaller than the amount of real capacity connected to the TF Grid. Due to this fact, the amount of tokens required to support liquidity on the market is growing faster than the tokens available.

1. Hardware connected to the ThreeFold_Grid by installing Zero-OS.
2. Decentralized blockchain issues specific amount of ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT) every month to the hardware owner into the specified wallet
3. Farmers can keep TFT for some time or sell to anyone else.
4. Anyone can buy TFT on an open market or directly from farmers.
5. When someone wants to run workloads on a farmer’s hardware, to reserve capacity they should use TFT. After reservation, TFTs go back to the farmer.
6. Anyone can buy TFT on an open market or directly from a farmer.
