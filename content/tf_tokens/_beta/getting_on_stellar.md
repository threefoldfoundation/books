## Getting TFTs on the Stellar network

<!--
TODO Generic description to get yourself / your threefold_connect on the stellar network and get (free) TFTs
-->

- - Getting Free TFT is currently only available on testnet, the website for production is coming soon. \*

### Getting your ThreeFold Connect to the Stellar network

The ThreeFold Connect app has a wallet inside, accessed using either the seed keys of the ThreeFold Connect app or an imported seed key.
The wallet allows you to show your balance in TFTs and FreeTFTs, as well as transferring (sending and receiving) tokens.
Trading on the StellarX DEX is not yet possible using ThreeFold Connect app (under construction). This is why it can be useful to install other wallets, which are able to do trades on the Stellar DEX.

### How to get a Stellar account in the ThreeFold Connect app

Accounts need to be activated on the Stellar network.
You can do this by sending an sms with the 5 character code to the shown sms number.

![sms_activ](3bot_staging_sms_activation.jpg)

Sending this sms will trigger the activation of a TFT account on the Stellar Network, and the creation of a trustline to the issuer of the token.
Once activation is done, you can start sending and receiving TFTs.

### Getting other Stellar wallets to add a TFT or FreeTFT account

A list of available Stellar wallets can be found [here](https://www.stellar.org/ecosystem/projects?tab=wallets#directory).

An account needs the below information keys to access the Stellar network.

ThreeFold_Token is registered under :

- `AssetCode` TFT
- `Issuer` GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

FreeTFT is a separate token with :

- `AssetCode` FreeTFT
- `Issuer` GCBGS5TFE2BPPUVY55ZPEMWWGR6CLQ7T6P46SOFGHXEBJ34MSP6HVEUT

Both TFT and FreeTFT are registered on this blockchain, under the domain `threefold.io` . Some wallets don't require you to introduce assetcode and issuer, but need this domain name to find back the tokens on the Stellar network.

## How to buy TFTs

Trading capabilities are not yet available in the ThreeFold Connect app.
As from April 29, TFTs are tradable on following exchanges.

### Centralized exchanges

- [Liquid](https://www.liquid.com/) (centralized exchange)
- [BTC Alpha](https://btc-alpha.com/en/) (centralized exchange)

### Stellar Decentralized exchange

You can also exchange TFTs with other tokens in a decentralized way, using StellarX, the Stellar decentralized exchange.

More info can be found [here](tft_stellarx.md).

## Pay for capacity

Capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid can only be bought using tokens. These tokens are registered on the Stellar network.

Two tokens can be used :

- TFT is the usual currency to be used for capacity reservation.
- FreeTFT is a token that is freely distributed to 3Bot users, for exploration of the capabilities. Every new 3Bot ID gets 1000 FreeTFT, which can be used for reserving capacity.

## How to get FreeTFTs

Every 3bot gives right to 1000 FreeTFTs, available to pay capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid.

To claim your 1000 FreeTFT, go to the website and claim your tokens.
