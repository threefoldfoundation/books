The ThreeFold Grid is the driving force of the next evolution of the Internet as it enables tokenized economic interactions without intermediaries. It provides a unique set of data, a universal state layer, also referred to as the ledger, which is collectively managed by a network of trusted nodes. This unique state layer allows people to exchange information and value in a peer to peer (P2P) way.
