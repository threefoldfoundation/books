## Sandboxes


> Deploy Secure Private Sandboxes (ultra private areas) for your workloads

Deploy secure apps inside sandboxes that have NO access to the internet, not in, not out. There are possibilities these days to avoid using internet protocols like http or tcp ip inside a secure environment. These are advanced techniques but super efficient to avoid hacking or vulnerabilities.

These sandboxes run compute and storage workloads, but cannot communicate with the internet.

People come in over secure application aware interfaces in such a way no harm can be done.

## **Keep all data in Secure Sandbox deployments**


![alt_text](img/sandbox.png)


Secure locations need to be a mix between distributed and centralized facilities but in such a way that data can never be lost nor modified.

The apps can only access data inside the secure sandbox and use unique storage technology (zero-knowledge proof). No data goes to laptops or desktops.

Access is always done by means of a secure browser or other access technology and audited where required. Only the output of the screen is shown to people in their laptops.

As a principle:



* No javascript applications running in browsers for secure government apps or data.
* All applications which need security are accessed using the secure remote access technology.
* On the network layer all data end2end encrypted with strong authentication.
* Data never leaves the sandbox and is dispersed and encrypted (multi layer) by design.
* All history of changes is kept with full audit trails.
* Blockchain technology is used to allow people with the right security clearance to see the audit trails when that would be required.
* Of course the secure sandbox needs to be secure and at least on 3 locations getting the data from distributed locations so that in case of disaster everyone can still continue.
