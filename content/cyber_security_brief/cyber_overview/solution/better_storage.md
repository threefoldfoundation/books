## Better Storage System

> Use Distributed Data Storage Systems, avoid Replication.

Also, centralized services are vulnerable, e.g. the best way to store data is using a quantum safe storage distribution system where not even a quantum computer can hack.Implement a new type of internet architecture, one which is much more decentralized.

Replication is a very bad approach, it leads to copying data to multiple locations leading to a bigger hacking surface! Please do not use replication in any of your data storage mechanisms.

There are storage systems today (some even as licensed opensource) which allow you to store data in such a way it can never be lost, stored over multiple locations, no data corruption can happen.
