# Introduction

# **Opinionated Cyber Security Brief**

Security and privacy are two topics of a major concern to every government in these challenging times. 

In one document it's impossible to give a complete overview nor a solution but we hope that we have provided some food for thought and a glimpse of a high-level strategy that will warrant much more detail and further consideration.

At a personal level, we are very motivated by the idea of creating an upgraded internet where every citizen can be free to learn, express themselves and partake. Of course, such an internet needs to be in line with government requirements.

We call this document an **“opinionated” document** because it's certainly not reflective of mainstream thinking. This document has been written as objectively as possible but by design is informed by our +30 years working in the internet industry. We were one of the early innovators on the internet and have dedicated our lives to making the internet a safer and more fair place. We are very disappointed by the solutions presented by the commercial IT ecosystem and believe they don’t have the people’s best interests at heart, they are mainly money- making machines. Complexity is their friend, and like a painkiller when a patient is sick, they neither address the root cause of the issue, nor do they deliver sustainable solutions.

**We believe solutions need to be created that empower a country and its government and give them everything they need to have 100% of their own future in their hands, with no strings attached.**

This can be done by:

- Having all code and knowledge inside the country.
- Building Education programs to make sure that further systems development can happen in the country.
- Creating organizations that are reliable and coming from the heart with love and loyalty for their country.
- Emphasizing the importance of values , this is not a marketing exercise, this needs to be the strong foundation of anyone helping their country to become digitally independent.
