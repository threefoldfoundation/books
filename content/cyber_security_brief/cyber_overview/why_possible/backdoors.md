## **Backdoors are in the majority of network attached devices**

![](img/backdoor2.png)  

Backdoors are the reality of digital life, they might have been created with the  right intentions but the unintended consequences are dramatic.

Every motherboard, router, hard disk, CPU … purchased today has backdoors inside.

While this was intended to only be used by certain “instances” , this has grown completely out of hand.

The root keys and secrets are known by many and can be used and abused by whoever wants to do so including bad actors.

> This is such a much more big problem than most people realize, its like a real pandemic its everywhere.

Hacking became a very big business, and the cyber attack pandemic became a reality. This topic should not be underestimated nor ignored, it's a sovereign issue, it's not too late now, but we need to act while there is still time.

### **Most network components are vulnerable and/or pre-hacked**

Routers, Wifi Bridges are ideal components for hackers to get into network traffic and intercept packets they are interested in. There are claims that more than 50% of routers and network components are vulnerable or hacked. Personally, I can believe this. Man in the middle attacks are easy to do, information can freely be found on the internet (just an example [article](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/conduct-a-simple-man-in-the-middle-attack-on-a-wifi-hotspot/)).
