# security products might be compromised

## **Some security products are compromised**

We are not implying that the products you buy now are compromised but they might be, we just want to point you to the possibility.

If you were a party looking for ways to access information, it might seem logical to insert “vulnerabilities” inside security products. 

It's a logical spot because these products are used to protect sensitive information, in other words allowing code and backdoors to be close to where the data and action is.

> **DO NOT BELIEVE THAT GETTING SECURITY OR PROTECTION CAN BE OUTSOURCED, YOU NEED PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ORGANIZATION THINKING ABOUT YOU < BEING YOU> !!!**


## **Most security protocols are vulnerable**

SSL is used everywhere to protect eCommerce and many more secured websites. SSL works based on a key exchange between client and server. Many routers on the internet are hacked (large majority) which leads to allowing “man in the middle attacks” to happen. It's a reality that most of the secure connections to centralized servers can be intercepted if there is any value to it.


Many of these protocols lead to a false sense of security.
