## **Hacking is a commercial business**

![](img/hackingroom.png)  

I personally only have knowledge of the pricing of 3 years ago but at that time it would cost about 50k USD to get the digital life of a person, everything: email, chats, passwords, bank detailsâ€¦

A VIP was of course more expensive. There are massive hacking companies operating globally which pre-hack most of the devices on the internet.

This leads to security for the rich and leaves others unprotected and vulnerable leading to a vicious cycle where the unprotected are more abused and find themselves with fewer chances for creating prosperity for their nation.

> Right now +- anything can be hacked its just a matter of price and time.
