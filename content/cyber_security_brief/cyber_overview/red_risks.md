# **Priority Red Risks**


![alt_text](img/cyber_lock.jpg)


This section is not meant to be a full description of security issues, rather a glimpse of what threats are both probable and possible today and should therefore be considered as risks for a nation.


## **There is a 3<sup>rd</sup> world war, it's a war on data and digital infrastructure.**

Data is the new gold of the digital universe, few global countries and some corporations have absolute dominance from this perspective.

In state of conflict first thing happening are actions to destabilize critical digital infrastructure:

- Ukraine, Russia took out 5 datacenters as first targets to destabilize the country and destroy important data for the country (e.g. birth certificates are now gone, land ownership…).
- Ukraine gets lots of denial of service attacks (only one of [sources](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukrainian-govt-sites-banks-disrupted-by-ddos-amid-invasion-fears/), other [one](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/catastrophic-cyber-war-ukraine-russia-hasnt-happened-yet-experts-say)).
- There are many other signs where cyber attacks are used to influence people or take over infrastructure.
- Countries are not prepared for these situations, example [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/wartime-bad-time-mess-internet).
- Intelligence Organizations, do harvest info, there are tons of links but some to start: [link1](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/heres-how-ice-illegally-obtained-bulk-financial-records-western-union).

Only very few countries in the world have enough resources to play in this 3<sup>rd</sup> digital world war, the other countries are completely unprotected and at the mercy of others.

Most of the IT (network) equipment bought comes from one of the big players and much of it is vulnerable by design.


## **Information is manipulated to organize state destabilizing actions**

**Information & public opinion became one of the most valuable commodities in the world**, companies are selling their soul for it, large governments are spending many billions of dollars to get access to the information and data in a structured way and prepare themselves for this 3<sup>rd</sup> world war. 

3 large countries with their direct allies have absolute dominance from this perspective, lots of games are being played in between, just like it would be in a real war with spies and double spies.

There are now tens of very concrete examples where governments were taken over because of mass manipulation.

A very concrete example was in Egypt, the revolution some years ago would not have been possible without manipulation of the (social) media. Lucky for Egypt, some groups of people managed to re-organize and undo some of the damage done and the 2e revolution happened, but it shows how dangerous it can be. This is like the box of Pandora, it's very dangerous to execute on and even more difficult to protect against.

Cyber manipulation and cyber attacks are the most efficient way to destabilize full countries and take over power. 

Countries like China and Russia have been preparing for this for many years now so they can cut their internet from the global one which we believe is NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION, this undo’s one of the most important happenings in the world during the last 100 years. The internet brought global access to information and collaboration possibilities. Going back to 100 separate internets would be a very bad move. But we might wonder, why do large powerful countries like this feel the need to be able to cut and separate/control their internet? 


## **Africa is a target, and is being taken over…**

Africa is super rich in natural resources (food, water, minerals, gold, …). Some large countries seem to do everything they can to destabilize Africa to allow them to extract even more.

Example, why are countries like Tanzania, one of the richest in the world for natural resources, still having one of the lowest GDP per capita?  A reason might be that Tanzania is being taken advantage of?

In the case of Tanzania, we are still lucky that there is a stable government with strong leaders,  a vision and good will to improve their country, but some other countries in Africa are not that lucky.

In our personal opinion the 3 main tools which make this possible are:

- Investment deals, putting countries in debt, and giving power to external parties.
- Mass scale, manipulation of internet information (in case of country take over, coup d’etat).
- Corruption = greed, leads to unfair deals for the country.

We see right now, there are geo-political movements happening. The big 3 are dividing Africa over themselves to secure their own future.

We believe information manipulation (cyber warfare, psychological info manipulation) is a requirement and the easiest way to make this possible.


## **A “cyber pandemic” is a reality**

Just like we have a virus based pandemic, the cyber pandemic is probably even more dangerous and life threatening.

Because of how big nations have been preparing their digital supremacy, lots of “viruses” have been created and have been deployed.



- Intel/amd: [info1](https://www.eteknix.com/nsa-may-backdoors-built-intel-amd-processors/), [info2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine), [info3](https://libreboot.org/faq.html#amd), [info4](https://news.softpedia.com/news/intel-x86-cpus-come-with-a-secret-backdoor-that-nobody-can-touch-or-disable-505347.shtml).
- Qualcomm: [info1](https://www.gsmarena.com/newscomm-49007.php), [info2](https://www.inquisitr.com/4658001/some-smartphones-powered-by-qualcomm-chips-come-with-a-hidden-backdoor/), [info3](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/15/16479330/oneplus-privacy-complaints-oxygenos-cybersecurity), [info4](https://www.inquisitr.com/4658001/some-smartphones-powered-by-qualcomm-chips-come-with-a-hidden-backdoor/),  [hightech](https://www.chrisdcmoore.co.uk/post/oneplus-analytics/).

There are hundreds of proof points, we just pointed to some. We know for a fact from people who do this work for a living, that +- everything is compromised with pre-planted vulnerabilities.

This is very similar compared to what can happen with a virus based pandemic, you pre-plan bio warfare, we can only imagine what happens after deploying such an attack, a real pandemic where some falsely believe they can control the outcome, this to us is the fastest path to destruction of potentially even the human race. 

The cyber pandemic is comparable, and is already there, maybe not deployed at full scale yet, but these backdoors are there, it's just a matter of time and money before they get exploited on a bigger scale.

In case you want some proof, today for less than 50k USD per year you can get access to someone’s full digital life and footprint (travel, information, data, financial transactions, …). Important people like presidents of course come at a premium.


## **Your current internet infrastructure is super vulnerable**

The Internet became very centralized, a denial of service attack can bring down full countries very fast.

90% of services used by citizens or governments rely on internet services out of the country, the moment some of the internet lines or crucial internet services like DNS (name services) are taken down is enough to take down the internet.

It's surprising to see how vulnerable the internet became and how few people actually understand this risk.

Possible ways how to bring internet down (these are only a few methods, there are many more):



- Often enough to cut 1 internet or large land cable, this will cause overloads on other internet lines, because of how the internet protocol (TCP) works, it would become unusable for +- all services.
- Do a denial of service attack on name servers in the country or outside, this means names would not be resolved to internet addresses, which means no service.
- Spoof routing protocols, make noise of routing updates, basically make the internet crazy and get it to think about routes which are slow or don’t exist.
- Do a denial of service attack on internet backbone services of a country, all will stop.
- Use some pre-hacked routers, to reroute traffic, again all would stop.
