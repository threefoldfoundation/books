## It is possible to build a unbreakable application ecosystem as alternative to centralized versions

It's work but it's possible to build a private local government IT system as alternative to:



* Whatsapp
* Google Docs or Office 365
* Dropbox or alternatives
* Centralized project or task management systems
* Zoom
* Youtube/Facebook/Linkedin

With a specialized team this can be created and deployed within 12 months for sure to the extent of happy users who would not feel the need to go elsewhere.

All software used would be open source and understood by teams in the country.

This system is 100% differently designed, more in line with true privacy and security. The description of such a system is outside of the scope of this document.


## Create an upgraded country wide internet system.

Such an upgraded internet would have huge benefits



* All data stays in the country
* No abuse of your citizens on centralized systems (less addiction, information manipulation, …)
* Much more performance & scale
* Way more reliable (less bandwidth issues, more uptime, …)
* A lot lower cost for the country
* Less security issues
* 10x less energy usage
