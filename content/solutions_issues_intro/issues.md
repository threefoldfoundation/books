![](img/issues.png)  

There are three critical issues that we have identified in the current internet that we believe must be addressed:
- There is a cyberpandemic going on, with cyber crime growing exponentially.
- For many countries, the internet is GDP negative and controlled by foriegn powers.
- The proposed solution of Central Bank Digital Currencies is actually flawed and must be carefully managed.
