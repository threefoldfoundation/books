## ANTIDOTE FOR CYBER PANDEMIC = PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE

![](img/cyberpandemic_fix.png)  

A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach in mind.

**This multi Trillion USD problem** will not go away by itself, we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for a cyber pandemic. This antidote is not a "layered on" painkiller quick fix, but a from the ground up re-engineered effective and break through solution.

Some possibilities:

* Liquid cooled edge distributed decentralized network of small edge datacenter nodes (can be basements or other hidden locations), decentralization leads to ability to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. 
* Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. Ultra scalable system.
* In country owned multilayer network communication encryption for government and other collaborators.
* Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox access and hosting of these apps.
* Use blockchain technology (BUT in country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or owned too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for OurLedgerCs.
* Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).

The more expensive goodies:

* An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). Is compatible with 4G devices, only authorized people can access. End2End encrypted, not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints can survive attacks and disasters.
* Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut in parts of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.
* A communication mechanism which is not using TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams in the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have less chance and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. Is expensive though but in our opinion worth it.
The most important requirement = sovereignty
* All critical software used should be owned in the country by local experts and all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to keep backdoors out and also keep things simple and integrated.
* Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.
* All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly happening in the country.
