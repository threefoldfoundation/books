# PRIVATE QUANTUM-SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE
## THE ANTIDOTE FOR THE CYBERPANDEMIC

A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach can solve the wave of cybercrime that the internet is experiencing today.

**This multi-trillion USD problem** will not go away by itself. we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for the cyberpandemic. This antidote is not a "layered on" painkiller quick fix, but a from-the-ground-up re-engineered, effective and breakthrough solution.

Some possibilities:

* A liquid cooled, edge distributed, decentralized network of small datacenter nodes (they can be in basements or other hidden locations). Through decentralization, we can achieve the redundacy necessary to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. 
* Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. This is also an ultra scalable system.
* A country-owned multilayer network communication encryption system for the government and other collaborators.
* Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox the access and hosting of these apps.
* Use blockchain technology (BUT within the country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, which do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or controlled too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.
* Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).

The more expensive solutions:

* An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in the harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). This secondary network would be compatible with 4G devices, where only authorized people can gain access, End2End encrypted and not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints mean extreme resilience to all attacks and disasters.
* Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut into chunks of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.
* A communication mechanism which does not use TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA-based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams within the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have are less probable and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. This is expensive though but, in our opinion, worth it. This fulfils the crucial need for sovereignty.
* All critical software used should be owned by local experts within the country and it all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to minimise backdoors and to keep things simple and integrated.
* Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.
* All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly should occur within the country.
