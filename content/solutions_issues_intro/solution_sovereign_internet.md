## SOVEREIGN COUNTRY INTERNET with many use cases inside

![image alt text](img/country_gdp_pos.png)

**Your Internet needs to become GDP Positive**

There needs to be a decentralized but ultra sovereign [digital backbone](/ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.md) which can deliver on the following requirements. This is for all citizens in the country (unlike as described in the previous section).

* All data stays in the country

* All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML). This identity needs to be unique on a national scale and be usable for all digital services of the government as well as the private sector.

* All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system with the following requirements:
    * Data should never be lost.
    * Data should never be corrupted.
    * The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.
    * All history should stay intact and data should not be modified.
    * Security should go beyond encryption technology as it is NOT enough. Security needs to be quantum safe.
    * The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and be scaleable to at least 1000 petabytes in order to be ready for the future.
    * Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) desired.
    * Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.
* The backbone needs to be flexible, which means usable for all required digital services.
* The backbone needs to be truly decentralized
    * Co-owned by the private sector and government institutions.
* The backbone needs to be truly sovereign.
    * Delivered by local teams operating within the country (living & working)
    * Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.
    * All source code must be open (open source)
    * Enough technically skilled people in the country to work & understand this code.
    * The code must have limitless usability and there can't be hidden costs (licenses, …) 
    * The country must be able to improve and develop the country from within its borders.
* Critical data means
    * All billing records.
    * Identity.
    * Utilization records.
    * Government information.
    * Government archives.
    * … to be further defined …

Internet & datacenter services need to contribute to the GDP of Country. Today the internet costs more money than it brings for most countries. By using a better digital system and new regulations, a country can greatly improve its revenue collection.

### More Decentralized And Fair Internet Connectivity Solution

We have our own 5G capable technology available which can be made part of the INCA project model. This would allows thousands if not millions of users to co-own their own telecom infrastructure to give them access to their future digital life.

### Digital HealthCare + Digitally Empowered Education System

Deliver solutions which cost less than what is available today and provide more inclusion; millions of people don’t have access to decent healthcare or education and this will improve that situation. Digital future technology has the capacity to make that happen. It is super important that this technology stays in line with the above requirements.

### Digital Future Life

Allow everyone in the country to participate in a more inclusive and  GDP-positive internet experience. There are a vast number of projects which fit this category, but it's all about providing a sovereign digital future for all the citizens of a country.

### A Public Unified and Sovereign Country Digital Backbone

The upgraded sovereign internet digital backbone needs to be able to support:

* Digital national identity management infrastructure.
* Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).
* Voting and other government services.
* Government collaboration system with far stronger security and data privacy measures.
* Education (deliver cost effective but capable education for everyone)
* Healthcare (medical records, global scalable healthcare for everyone)
* Mining industry (fairer redistribution for a country's natural resources)
* Land bank (registry for all land)
* Transparent revenue collection
* Port authorities (avoid fraud)

### A government collaboration system

Without going into detail national cyber security is becoming a major topic of the future. See what happened with Ukraine, the first Russian attack eliminated their core digital backbone and datacenters.

We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only open source components are used, which are understood by technical teams with a deep level of expertise on those components.

Some ideas

* Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.
* Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie [EMP](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm)-safe.
* Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.
* Strong authentication.
* Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.
* Data storage is quantum safe.
* Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).

This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable [PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE](solution_cyberpandemic.md).
