Web 4.0 and Banking 4.0 Platform

Blockchains are leading the way to the next disruption in the FINTECH industry.

DeFi (Decentralize Finance) and Digital Ledger technology (Blockchain) allow much more cost-effective deployments, at larger scale, without having to rely on ultra expensive and complicated old fashioned financial backend systems.

|Non Transparent Fee Structure|Transparent Fee Structure|Transparent Fee Structure, DAO Based Governance, Made for volume.
|Unsafe, bank’s hacks are all over, complexity leads to security risks.|Hacking is still a real danger because of centralization.Very safe, probably the safest at this stage. Low cost to operate. Strong integration with regulation.|Cannot compete with newer digital systems, ± impossible to make really safe.|
|Is regulated, enormous growth. These systems have the capability to replace a larger part of classic banks for a large part of functions, which means classic banks become more specialized and have the risk of ending up with a non profitable business case.|Central banks are starting to work on CBDC (central bank digital currency) using blockchain tech.|In older blockchain systems (not ours) people might abuse the information as stored on blockchain (trading pre-knowledge, bots, …). These systems might also be too limited in functionality today, can be used as a base for a new revolutionary banking system.
