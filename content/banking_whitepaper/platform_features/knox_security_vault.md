As an option, one or more secure areas can be used to provide offline storage of keys and digital currency cold wallets.

Each Knox Security Vault is an ultra safe area. Thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage system, it is not possible to retrieve a key even if a hacker would be in one safe, as a combination of three safes is required to recover information.

We suggest using one way key storage, e.g. each wallet from a user, stores the encrypted dispersed key distributed over 4 or 5 Knox Security Vaults. Only in case of disaster and user strong identification, users can get access (can also be used to deal with death of the customer, and how to handover to relatives).
