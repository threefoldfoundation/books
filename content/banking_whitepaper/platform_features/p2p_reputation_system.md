# Peer To Peer Reputation System (phase 2)

Reputation could be a nice add-on to the banking offerings to allow banking customers to see the reputation of the people they are transacting or doing business with.

We are developing a unique peer to peer reputation system to allow the power of network effects to come with strong verification and reputation proofs. We think that this might become an important added value a bank could deliver to its customers. This is a feature which does not cost money but is of high added value for your customer.
