# DeFi and Peer To Peer Exchange

![alt_text](img/defi_exchange.png "image_tooltip")


DeFi is an amazing trend which banks should try to leverage, if not for internal usage, to provide a more transparent and safe way for their customers to exchange their currencies (digital and fiat) in a fully regulated environment.

We have all the building blocks available to make this work.

This can be implemented in a fully peer to peer way, while using DeFi Smart Contracts on the blockchain.
