# Quantum Safe Storage

Imagine a storage system with the following benefits:



* upto 10x more efficient (power and usage of hardware)
* ultra reliable, data can not be lost
* ultra safe & private
* ultra scalable
* sovereign, data is close to you in the country of your choice
* true Peer To Peer, by everyone for everyone.

It is not a dream, it does already exist, and is the underpinning of the ultra safe **Cloud System** empowering this solution. Our storage architecture follows the true Peer To Peer design. Any participating nodes (can be on ultra safe locations) only store small incomplete parts of data (files, photos, movies, databases…) by only offering a slice of their current (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all these ‘distributed fragments’ is done by a software that creates ‘development and/or end-user interfaces’ for this storage algorithm. We call this ‘dispersed storage‘.

See in Appendix A to learn more about how Quantum Safe storage works.
