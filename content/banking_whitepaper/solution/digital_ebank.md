# Digital e-Bank Solution

We aim to deliver a product comparable to Revolut ([https://www.revolut.com/](https://www.revolut.com/)) which, in our opinion, did an amazing job in providing a user-friendly interface packed with nice features. Our solution will be based on a more secure blockchain technology (which is not the case for Revolut) and web 4.0, have a lower cost base, much safer, and be future proof.

We suggest implementing the new platform in multiple phases.


## Phase 1

Core banking features of

* Multiple accounts, (Current, Savings, Fix Deposit)
* Account linked with debit cards,
* VISA, MC or Union Pay branded Credit Cards 
* Fund Transfer and Remittance
* Exchange between currencies and chosen set of reliable digital currencies,
* Personal finance manager / Coach / Set savings goals /Spend analytics
* KYC/AML verification process,
* Basic internal and external (regulatory) reporting on transactions, 
* Review all relevant documents (T&C, agreements, other product related documents …)
* Back office functionalities such as organization setup, set GL,COA, accounting, profit distribution modules, product configuration, process flow, dashboards, other various teller functions/management functions, reporting engine. 
* Ecosystem integration ( revenue-producing business processes with ecosystem partners)

All accounts and account holdings are stored on the banking core blockchain. Identity and verification (e.g. KYC) is also stored on the same blockchain.

Exchange is implemented using DeFi mechanisms (Atomic Swapps and/or on Chain DeFi).

Browser Firewall is used to protect all access from customers to their twins. Each twin has all the knowledge required to be an independent actor in the banking system. Each customer can either freeze or delete their twin at any point in time, and close their account following a ‘predefined’ process. 

All data is stored on blockchain and/or on ‘Quantum Safe Storage’ system, the banking system will be 99% ‘self-healing’, and would barely require any human intervention. This leads to incredible security and high up-time. 

The purpose is to automate the full banking process as much as possible. The aim is to have a monthly cost between 1-5 USD per user per month, depending on the size of the deployment and requested features. 

Various freemium and premium plans will be offered to the customer. 

Example of a million user network could cost about 1 million USD per month to operate end to end, which would be  quite exceptional and open the doors to lots of new opportunities. This cost could then be charged to the customer as a Premium model (same as Revolut). 



## Phase 2

Possible integration with



* Banking Enabled Metaverse technology,
* Augmented reality,
* AI driven bots helping customers in the secure metaverse to get support,
* Virtual reality banking experience (helpdesk, …),
* Integration with eCommerce systems (allow everyone to seamlessly accept payments) directly onto their banking account.

Provide a more playful but yet ultra secure experience with the banking applications & services.


## Phase 3

Additional banking features



* Digital Currency integration with the outside world,
* Insurance products,
* Investment products,
* Etc.

Of course, together we will  need to define which if any of these possibilities are of interest.
