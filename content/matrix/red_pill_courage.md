# Do we have the courage to take the red pill?

Morpheus gives a choice to Neo to escape the Matrix he lives in. We all should make that choice, do we stay in the Matrix, do we keep on pretending all is well and act as a victim and expect others to resolve it for us. 

NO, we want to make change now, 
it is all still possible, **but we need to make the choice that we have a choice.**


## Time is not our friend.

Till to date most of our effort has been engineering focussed, now it's time to grow and create a sustainable structure. With our current organization we cannot deliver on our potential, hence the requirement for the DAO.

Our joint current burn rate is about 800k USD per month, it needs to grow, more funding is required.

More than 150 people are working on this quasi full time. We have hundreds of contributors helping part time, mainly out of enthusiasm for the idea. This needs to grow to thousands.

This is not enough, the task we are having in front of us is huge.

The plan is practical, a decentralized movement of people work together over the DAO to make it all happen. It's not a “survival of the fittest” approach, it's a collaboration. All the technology is 100% available to the Phoenix Dao. All the basic building blocks are there.

Do we believe this is possible YES, quite some of us came from an incubator ([www.incubaid.com](http://www.incubaid.com)) who was successful (500m USD exits), and it allowed us to learn a lot in how it can be done.
