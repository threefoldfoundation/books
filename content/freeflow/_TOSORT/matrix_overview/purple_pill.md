# Maybe we need a purple pill. A pill from the heart.

Let's create a system which follows another paradigm:


|GOOD = Heart Driven|BAD = Fear Driven|
|---|---|
|Empowering|Controlling|
|Networks|Hierarchies|
|Transparency|Secrecy|
|Purpose, money as a gift.|Profit, money as a drug.|
|Give First, Receive Later|Take first, maybe Give Back Later|
|Collaborate.|Survival of the fittest|
|Sustainability|Unhealthy drive for over optimization=efficiency|
|The power is within us. We need to choose that we have a choice, we are not powerless.|Stardom, we need heroes, we want what they achieved, the so-called “way” out of the matrix.|

## Our kids are afraid, they don’t see a future. 

The world is a challenging place today, climate change is real, abuse of full countries is real, a constant war is going on, war has never been out of our life, we only choose to blind ourselves to it…

Our kids are afraid, they don’t see a future.  The “matrix” we created together over the last 100 years, is crashing in front of them. They know and feel, financial systems are no longer reliable, interest created debt everywhere in such a way it enslaves people and countries, often their governments are unable to act and definitely not with right insight and values which relate to them, the planet is suffering because of abuse of its resources and complete lack of respect for its beauty, climate change is happening, …

Many kids are afraid, might choose to lose themselves in virtual fake worlds (gaming, social media, …), or hope to hit the jackpot thanks to crypto. Most don’t even dare to think about it, ignoring seems to be the easier option. 


## What is the start of the solution?

Do we need to clean rivers,  \
> or do we need to raise awareness so people and companies will stop polluting? 

Do we need to build machines to suck carbon out of the air 
> or maybe eating & consuming differently has more impact. 

Do we need more debt to resolve our financial crisis,
> or maybe we need to change the way we deal with money, money is a “taboo”,  \
most people don't know anything about Money, there are no classes about it,   \
money is “frozen time energy”and can be beautiful if created, exchanged and used well.

**We believe the start of the solution is growing awareness.** \


Awareness about the planet and how our own actions bring positive or negative change.

Spiritual awareness about ourselves and our capabilities.

We don’t believe the solution will come from a government, a new hero or a large company, this has been tried over and over. We will stay on the wrong side of the table above. 

Change starts with all of us, we need hope, we need tools which allow us to \




* Communicate in all freedom. 
* Get access to unbiased information (that is neither controlled or manipulated)
* Share our wealth of knowledge, become teachers and as a result learn more.
* Create digital complementary currencies for our communities, use money as a tool/gift. A mechanism to exchange/share wealth, not with the purpose to make the wealthy few even richer.
* Find everything we’re looking for easily without losing a large part of our buying power doing so.
* Meet and collaborate together in a safe (virtual) location.
* Trade, exchange in safe ways, not only for the benefit of the controlling party.

Decentralization where people can empower themselves, is a good start. Blockchain has been painted as the solution for this, but is this good enough?


## Blockchain, a good first step but it's not enough



1. Blockchain is not decentralized enough.
    1. Many blockchains still use centralized cloud providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, …
    2. Proof of “block” stake is a good mechanism but often used for greed, less for security.
2. Blockchain is not as reliable as people believe, 
    3. Consensus needs to be achieved, there are lots of moving parts, network connectivity needs to be there, what if there will be network cuts or other more serious outages 
3. Blockchain is slow and not scalable, it's not a swiss army knife.
    4. It's a distributed architecture based on replication,  \
there is limited control over data positioning, this makes it slow for certain use cases.
4. Biggest issue, a big part of the ecosystem around blockchain is money hungry
    5. Some of the projects are nothing more than hyped up pyramid money making systems for the investors. Real innovation is not in line to hype. We don’t need +10 global blockchains competing for the so-called ”future of money or internet”. 
    6. Blockchain will not and cannot resolve the future of the internet by itself, it's an incredible tool just like virtualization was before, lots of problems IT industry is working on for +40 years, blockchain sort of doesn’t change that, it brings another super useful tool.
    7. Why are projects with no real product and “real” utilization valued  at +10 Billion USD? \


How is blockchain doing in relation to our awareness table? \



|BAD = Fear Driven|Blockchain|
|---|---|
|Controlling|Most of them are quite centralized, unfortunately.|
|Hierarchies|Pricing, code controlled from the center.|
|Secrecy|not enough transparency, complexity everywhere.|
|Profit, money as a drug.|Blockchains, lots of greed today|
|Take first, maybe Give Back Later|Yes ICO, is basically this.|
|Survival of the fittest|Yes, everyone is fighting for dominance.|
|Efficiency: how to do more with less|Blockchains are seldom efficient.|
|Stardom, we need heroes, we want what they achieved, the so-called “way” out of the matrix.|It's all about the heroes...|



We love the technology behind blockchain, it's an amazing powerful tool, but it got hijacked.

We love the blockchain community for:



* Complementary currencies with DEFI, this is an incredible purpose.  \
99% of the real innovation on blockchain sits here.
* Decentralized leger (documents which need to be replicated and consensus driven) \
Like a digital notary. But just like you wouldn’t ask your notary to store all your data, the same applies for a blockchain. It's not useful to store your digital life, there are better ways.
* Smart contracts can help for e.g. anti fraud, new business tools, voting, billing, …
* **There are lots of incredible people in the blockchain community who live for making the world another place and as sort of hackers, they push change forward.**
