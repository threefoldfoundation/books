# OURWORLD is a decentralized movement for change


![alt_text](img/coins_minimum_wage.png )


Our decentralized group of projects and people have already achieved a lot.



* ThreeFold has built a decent foundation for the new Digital Backbone for the world, multiple countries and large communities are now taking steps to implement. 18000 CPU cores and 80.000.000 GB of storage are deployed.
* TAG works with 2.4m students doing educational climate change projects for farming carbon credits which are used by ThreeFold for carbon offsetting. 
* More than 200 internet farmers have deployed and invested in computer hardware to let the new internet backbone grow, more than 20m USD invested so far by these farmers.
* More than 20 projects with existing internet solutions/apps/blockchains are ready to deploy on the new internet backbone. We need more people to help.
* Some larger communities (+1m people) are ready to move to the new internet, but more work needs to be done to finish the solutions they need.
* A whatsapp, google docs, zoom, facebook alternative has been created and ready to be tested.
* An educational platform is active which has 4 billion views on educational content, this needs to become an integral part of the grid.
* A new metaverse has been created, which is super beautiful and based on other values. Can also be tested
* A group of “love warriors” from Lebanon is going global and actively pushing the movement.
* And so much more is happening… sorry for all the ones we didn’t mention here.


## The following action points are urgent



* Purchase computers !!!! The world is running out of hardware. This is most urgent.
* Deployment of much more Internet Capacity and Telecom Capacity (we have our own).
* Find more funding for the DAO, super important = is our fuel.
* Awareness creation.. Education for communities everywhere to build their own digital and eco future.
* Internationalization of the platform (more languages)
* Buy ThreeFold Tokens to support the projects (TFT is the currency of this new internet).
* Deploy a ThreeFold Validator (50 left) = security for the project
