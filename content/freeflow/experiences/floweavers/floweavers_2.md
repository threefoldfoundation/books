## Share itt

Share itt is an existing platform: The Shareitt platform makes it fun and easy to exchange second-hand used or new items.  This implementation of Shareitt is not a centralized platform on which all items are listed on a single site, no this decentralized version is where the user manages its own platform for their os items on sale.

### Next Generation Marketplace
Shareitt allows users to exchange items they don't need or are no longer using, no matter the type of item, its size or worth. Each item uploaded to the marketplace gets its own unique value in Shareitt points and becomes available to tens of thousands of users who can request the item in exchange for points. Points earned then allow users to receive items they want from other users, and so on.

### Currency: Out, Points: In
Shareitt commerce is not based on money. Shareitt points are accumulated by users in different ways and may then be "spent" in our dynamic marketplace, which has tens of thousands of items in different categories. The best way to earn Shareitt points is to upload as many items as possible and exchange them â€“ for points - with other users.

### Substantial social catalog
The items on the Shareitt platform are uploaded to the marketplace by users, in a quick, simple process. The more detailed the item description, the more attractive it is for other users. High-quality pictures, detailed descriptions, diverse categories, and great points value - generate thousands of exchanges every day. Together, we are creating an extensive social catalog being used by tens of thousands of users.

### So many gifts!
When you register, each user is awarded with 100 points as a welcome gift so that you may enjoy the experience on your first visit. In order to earn Shareitt points, we recommended uploading and offering as many items as possible to other users. Another way to earn points is by redeeming gifts received for your actions on the platform: uploading items, giving, exchanging, granting wishes, inviting friends, and more.

### A new collaborative economy
At Shareitt, we believe in a collaborative economy in which the individual gives to the community, the community creates value for the individual, and everyone benefits. Hundreds of communal platforms have been created in different fields in recent years. Shareitt users participate in social commerce by exchanging items for points and create a new collaborative economy together.
