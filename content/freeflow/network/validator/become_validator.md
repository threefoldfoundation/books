![](img/validator.png)  

A validator earns 10% of all CHI spent on the network for network services as

- compute (compute units)
- storage (storage units)
- network (network units)
- specific added value services for the digital twins

At start there will only be 99 validators.

During the first year the validators will make 10% on all farming done as additional benefit with a maximum of 50.000 CHI per validator per month.

> You will be able to reserve you validator starting Q4 2022. You will need 500.000 CHI to reserve a validator. The validator supports delegated staking till 2m CHI, which means others can delegate their stake on your validator, to do so they will reward you with 10% of their reward as extra bonus.
