Farming is the process of adding Internet capacity (compute, storage and network) to the ThreeFold Grid. 

ThreeFold uses a proof-of-blockstake consensus mechanism. By running Zero-OS on their hardware, Farmers dedicate the computation power and storage capacity of their node to the network, enabling anyone to host data and run IT workloads on a decentralized Internet infrastructure.

In decentralized systems like ThreeFold, we need to ensure that everyone is able to provide Internet capacity to the world. Farmers help this happen by connecting hardware that run Zero-OS. Once booted, the hardware is locked to generate Internet capacity for the network. The capacity is registered on TFChain, securing access to a decentralized Internet for users and rewarding farmers with TFT.

<!-- 

Farmers make this happen by recording the Internet capacity they make available to the network 

Farmers connect hardware called 3Nodes to provide Internet Capacity and are consequently rewarded with ThreeFold Token (“TFT”). The 3Node can be installed at home or any location where existing internet connectivity is available. Every month that the 3Node is up and running and connected to the internet, Farmers receive TFT. 
 
Everyone in the world can now use this Compute, Storage, and Network Capacity to deploy apps onto these 3Nodes instead of using centralized datacenters.  -->
