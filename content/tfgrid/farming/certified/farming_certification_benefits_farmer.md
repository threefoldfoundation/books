## For The Farmer

### Higher Cloud Unit Reward reward = more income

A certified farmer gets more farming_rewards because a certified farmer need to adhere to higher service level agreements and buy certified farming solutions or certifiy their existing 3nodes.

### TF Tech Support

Direct defect and certified build support for Zero-OS from the software creators for the tfgrid_primitives on TFGrid.

### Lower Operational Cost

Certified farms can use the TFTech power management solution which makes sure that 3Nodes are only powered on when there is a need for it. This can save huge amounts of electricity.

### Easier to get to minimal required 30% utilization

The tokens farmed for a 3Node are locked up in a staking pool untill the 3Node gets to 30% utilization.

This is to make sure that people cannot put hardware to the grid which cannot be used and as such get farming rewards.

ThreeFold needs to make sure that there is no abuse and also that 3Nodes are not brought life for just farming which would burn energy for no reason.

ThreeFold & ThreeFold Tech will do a lot of promotion and find channel_partners to get the TFGrid to grow as fast as possible and get capacity used.

Its up to ThreeFold to make sure that certified capacity gets deployed where it is needed first.

All of this leads to much faster utilization of the TF_Farm IT capacity which results in the TF_Farmer getting access to their farmed tokens faster.

### Higher Credibility Because Of Certification

Security advantage as farm, location and nodes have been thoroughly checked and documented (secure boot process guarantees the most stable (best) Zero OS version). This information gets checked by ThreeFold which means the TFGrid user will more likey chose a certified farmer.

### Custom Network (\*):

Ability to implement custom networking based on VxLAN or many other networking technologies.

This is needed for deployments in hybrid or even full private mode where customers have very specific requirements around networking.

### Farmer Bot (\*)

A farmer bot will be made available which makes it easier for a certified farmer to manage their farm in relation to

- power management
- management farmed tokens
- network management tools
- lockout bad actors (e.g. deny access for hackers or other bad actors)
- ...

### Monitoring Integration (\*)

Possibility to integrate custom monitoring solutions.

### Reputation System (\*)

Farmers and TFGrid users are rated by a reputation system.
These reputation scores will be visible on the TF_Chain

This allows a farmer to see that the TFGrid users on the TF_Farm can be trusted.
