## For The ThreeFold Grid User.

Users of the ThreeFold Grid have an advantage to use a farmer who is certified.

### More information about the farm

Whoever wants to use capacity from the grid gets more information about

- connection capabilities to the internet
- quality of hardware used
- service level agreements
- location of the TF_Farm (country,...)
- protection mechanisms around fire, water, ...

This information is important for the TFGrid user to make selection where to host their IT workloads.

TFTech will validate this information.

### More uptime

Being certified means that the farmer likely will have more uptime compared to a non certified farmer.

### More security

As part of the certification process, TFTech will make sure that the 3Node has secure boot procedures to allow for more security. The Farmer needs to sign an agreement with ThreeFold Foundation where they commit to a set of standards and security requirements.

### More legal protection

Each certified farmer has to adhere to a set of terms & conditions which protect the TFGrid User.

The terms & conditions describe

- privacy & security protections
- compliance to legal requirements
- protection against abuse

### Continuation protection.

The TF_Farmer has to promise to keep the farm operational till the end as specified on farming certificate which gets registered on the TFChain.

- [more info about requirements see here](farming_certified_requirements)

### TFGrid User Can Have Support

All support inquiries will be handled through blocks of 15 minutes which are paid for in ThreeFold Support Tokens(TFTS).

Any TFGrid user can ask for support but only for certified farms.
