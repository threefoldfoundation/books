## Certified Farming Requirements 

### Individual Certified Farmer

- Certified Farms are made up of certified_nodes
- up to 4 certified nodes
- home or office location

#### Uptime and Network Requirements

- 97% uptime is accepted in home farming situations
- 1 IP feed (consumer provider)
- 1 public IP address and NAT allowed
- enough bandwidth to allow the utilization of the storage/archive (see below)
- good enough latency (low latency = performance of network)

### Professional Certified Farmer

- Certified Farms are made up of certified_nodes
- more than 4 certified nodes
- datacenter location

#### Uptime and Network Requirements

- 99.5% uptime
- minimal bandwidth as required for the workloads as hosted on the farm
- maximum network latency
- more than 1 internet connection (multiple IP feeds)
- enough IPv4 addresses
- at least 1 class C ipv4 addr for network farmers.
- enough bandwidth to allow the utilization of the storage/archive (see below)
- good enough latency (low latency = performance of network)
- [install your network in line with Threefold Requirements](tfgrid_networking)

(*) = in case of datacenter or commercial deployment

#### Redundancy Requirements

- protection for fire & water damage
- enough access to power
- redundant power systems

#### Terms and Conditions need to be signed

### Bandwidth Requirement for archive/storage usecase example.

A storage usecase needs a lot of bandwidth to allow the storage nodes to be filled and also to allow its customers to download the information.

Itâ€™s the obligation of the farmer to make sure that enough bandwidth is available. We will measure this by doing random upload & download tests to the storage systems. 

It should always be possible to have at least 1 mbit/sec per Zero_DB (which is a storage container running on 1 harddisk or ssd).

### Reputation & Monitoring Engine

The TFGrid has a reputation engine and a monitoring engine to measure uptime & other SLA requirements, see consensus3.

Factors the TFGrid Reputation_engine will look at (Q4 2021, latest Q1 2022) 

- Available Bandwidth
- Latency
- Utilization
- Uptime (nodes & network)

The monitoring engine could require farmers to execute on certain actions.
