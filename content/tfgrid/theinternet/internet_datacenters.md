# The Internet Data Centers

Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:

## Centralization

The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.

## Cost

It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model.

## Energy Consumption

Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage an around 205 TWh of energy - more than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.

## Security

The current IT stack depends on human infallibility and as such, human error has been considered the primary cause of 95% of cybersecurity breaches. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information.

## Cannot Support Future Demand

To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will need to be built and will consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japanâ€™s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.
