## Resource Units

Resource units are used to measure and convert capacity on the hardware level into cloud units: CU & SU.


| Unit Type    | Description                          | Code |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| Core Unit    | 1 Logical Core (Hyperthreaded Core)  | CRU  |
| Mem Unit     | 1 GB mem                             | MRU  |
| HD Unit      | 1 GB                                 | HRU  |
| SSD Unit     | 1 GB                                 | SRU  |
| Network Unit | 1 GB of bandwidth transmitted in/out | NRU  |

These are raw capacities as measured by the ThreeFold software running on Zero-OS.
