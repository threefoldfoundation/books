## Together we build our own future with the Internet of Internets.

ThreeFold is a movement. All of us together, we are creating the Internet of Internets – a system of local internets for us to connect and exchange information and value without limitations or intermediaries. 

To learn more about ThreeFold read our litepaper on [http://litepaper.threefold.me](http://litepaper.threefold.me).

Each local Internet is owned by all of us ("people"), together – an equality and abundance-based paradigm to benefit and provide fair value exchange for the collective and each of us individually. A planet-first, people-first philosophy that shapes the future we want to live in. Without our planet, we have nothing. And we believe people need a better system. One they can depend on. One that allows everyone to provide economic flow. One that gives them the opportunity to thrive.

This document describes how liquidity will be the result of real utilization which means:

* Deployment of validators on the main chain (L2 validators = staking).
* Deployment of validators for each regional internet 
* Funding of the liquidity pools in each regional internet (CHI vs TFT).
* Paying for utilization of the TFGrid + staking to get more discount on TFGrid.
* Reserve currency for all regional internets (CHI is only valid in 1 regional Internet, TFT allows bridging)

Because we don’t do fake market making and we didn't accept funding from investors to fund our token raise (some call this pump and dump), we will have to be patient and wait till more utilization is required till we get to enough liquidity. 

Our future is 100% decentralization where our token doesn’t need centralized market makers nor centralized exchanges. Every participant to the network can be a liquidity provider and our token is stored on multiple money blockchains (today we use Stellar, we are considering adding Algorand).

The ThreeFold token TFT is a token with real utility value and as ThreeFold we are only at the start of our journey.
