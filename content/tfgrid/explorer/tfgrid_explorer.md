![](img/grid_stats_.png)

Thousands of 3Nodes are connected to the ThreeFold Grid across the world. 

### TF GRID EXPLORER – Total Capacity

Find the live stats across Grid versions on https://explorer.threefold.io/all.

The explorer allows you to find:
- Available 3Nodes and web gateways 
- Live statistics about the ThreeFold Grid 
- Live capacity map

It shows you the total stats for all active Grid versions.

The filter options allow you to choose between: 
* The different Grid versions: Grid 2 & 3, Grid 3, Grid 2
* The different networks: all, devent, testnet, mainnet

### TF GRID EXPLORER 3.0

> Is a subset of the total net and will grow as people upgrade their [3Nodes](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/3node).

This new explorer receives its information via GraphQL straight from the [ThreeFold Blockchain](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfchain). It allows you to explore all farms and 3Nodes using multiple filtering options. Choose between the different networks:
* Devnet Explorer: https://explorer.dev.grid.tf/
* Testnet Explorer: https://explorer.test.grid.tf/
* Mainnet Explorer: https://explorerv3.grid.tf/

**Features:**

- Using the `Capacity finder` panel, you can filter out the nodes based on their farm and resource units.
- By clicking on a node or a gateway, you get access to a full information view, as shared below. 
- The information view lets you inspect a specific node or gateway in more details. Next to basic information (like farm, location, uptime), you can also find the primitives currently provisioned on the node and how much resource is available on the node or gateway.
