## What is Zero-OS?

Zero-OS is a lightweight and efficient operating system. There is no shell, local nor remote (unless when run in debug mode).
It supports a small number of _primitives_; the low-level functions it could perform natively in the operating system. ZeroOS (ZOS) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity required by the solutions running on the TFGrid.

zos has been developed by ThreeFold from scratch, starting from the Linux kernel with as purpose to improve on efficiency, energy usage, performance, scale, cost of management and security.

### Why

- Most centrally managed operating systems rely on human management and intervention, which leads to downtime and security issues. 
- Since the creation of the Internet, the development of operating systems mostly arised through the addition of further layers of code to improve capabilities and functionalities of software, this leads to too much complexity, performance loss and energy usage issues.
- To build a truly scalable, private and efficient Internet infrastructure, we had to start from scratch to ensure a minimal hacking surface, improve efficiency, and ensure that anyone who connects hardware to the ThreeFold Grid wouldn't be able to access the private user data thanks to our qsss.

The result is game-changing as zos is able to provide the follwoing benefits:

- **Stateless**: Without shell, local or remote, it does not allow for inbound network connections to happen nor can data be fetched by node operators.
- **Lightweight**: Zero-OS can save up-to 10X energy on storage workloads.
- **Autonomous**: It runs by itself and doesn't require humans to maintain it, removing human error and considerably reducing the hacking surface. 
- **Decentralized**: Deploy IT workloads and infrastructures in a private and neutral environment. 
- **Secure**: Store workloads in a quantum safe (future proof) way. 
- **Private**: Communicate end-to-end without centralized servers or APIs in the middle. 
- **Compatible**: Run anything that can run on Linux but in a decentralized environment.
