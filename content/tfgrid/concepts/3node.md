## What is a 3Node?

The ThreeFold Grid consists of many 3Nodes distributed around the world by independent people and organizations called Farmers ("Farmers"). An example of a Farmer is [Green Edge Cloud](https://www.greenedgecloud.com/). 

A 3Node is a computer or server that runs Zero-OS connects compute, storage and network capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. 3Nodes work together to create an independent peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure that can be used by anyone to run applications or store data. A 3Node can be utilized by anyone who wants to use a private Internet infrastructure with an immutable record of events in time. 3Nodes provide the following benefits:

- **Compatible**: Any Intel or AMD chip server hardware can be used to create a 3Node.
-  **Efficient**: By distributing the Internet infrastructure across different locations, 3Nodes require less bandwidth and less maintenance than the data center model.
- **Scaleable**: 3Nodes can be deployed anywhere electricity and connectivity is present, including remote areas. 
- **Secure**: Once booted by Zero-OS, 3Nodes are locked by the system preventing data access on a hardware level. 
- **Sustainable**: 3Nodes require less energy to run than data center racks as they do not require cooling power. 

Anyone can use 3Nodes to build software and IT infrastructures, as well as store anything from pictures to archives on the ThreeFold Grid using TF Chain and Zero-OS. 3Nodes. All 3Nodes connected to the ThreeFold Grid are registered in a database called the ThreeFold Directory (“TF Directory”), which registers the internet capacity available on the ThreeFold Grid Explorer. This process is called Proof-of-Capacity.
