TF Farmers farm ThreeFold_Tokens by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold_Grid.

As a result of farming, Internet capacity is generated and made available on the ThreeFold_Grid.

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:

- Farming: as a result of connecting server/storage hardware to the ThreeFold_Grid
- Utilization: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised (sold) by ThreeFold_Grid Users

There are two types of capacity farmers:

- Certified Farmers: A certified hardware using farmer that has entered into, and is compliant with, the present Terms of the TFTech Service Level Agreement.
- DIY Farmers: Use their own choice of hardware (uncertified hardware).
