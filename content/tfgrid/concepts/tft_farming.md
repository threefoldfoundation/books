## ThreeFold Token Farming (our alternative to minting)

![](img/whatisafarmer.jpg)

TF Farmers farm ThreeFold_Tokens by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold_Grid.
As a result of farming, Internet capacity is generated and made available on the ThreeFold_Grid.

This is our alternative to Token Minting.

For the purpose of farming, TF Tokens upto 4 Billion, are in a locked pool which only get unlocked as the result of farming as done by TF_Farmers.
See [Farming Rewards](farming_reward) for more info.
