# Layer 1 = OurWorld Regional Internet 

Every community in the world can deploy their own Regional OurWorld Internet, a regional Internet that scales for millions of users. The Regional Internet has its own blockchain and can operate 100% independent from the other Regional Internets. Of course lots of connections are made between the Regional Internets.

A Regional Internet starts with max 99 founding fathers or mothers who deploy blockchain nodes with integrated support for DEFI. Each Regional Internet has its own ThreeFold Token (colored version), differences in farming & cultivation model are possible. Each Regional Internet has a DEFI pool to allow frictionless exchange between the master TFT and the TFT of each region.
