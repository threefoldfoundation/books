# Experience Matters

We were fortunate to be part of the first rollout of the Internet in the early 1990â€™s.

Our team has multiple world records for scaling projects on the Internet, invented the first data deduplication system for backup, the first ultra scalable distributed storage system using forward-looking error correcting codes, one of the first cloud systems, the first always consistent distributed database, and the first decentralized operating system using blockchain technology. The team has achieved over +500m USD in exits to Sun Microsystems, Western Digital, Verizon, Symantec, and others. 

Our ThreeFold system brings us back to the Internet as originally conceived. A collaborative and community-based network of compute, storage and network resources, peer-to-peer connected and delivered by all. Only this time, we can use advanced technologies and structures which were only developed very recently.
