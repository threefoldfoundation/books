# Introduction

Imagine a world where “YOU” are the Internet.

Imagine a world where communities can build their own Internet,  \
			from scratch, an Internet which would deliver all the needs for a better future life. 

This new Internet is here! It includes:



* a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold
* a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on an equal basis to learn,  \
create, exchange, travel, … basically to experience an abundance-based world

Abundance is our baseline:



* An abundance of free information, education, knowledge (books, journals, studies), planetary information (maps), creativity (music, video, digital art, immersive museums).
* Access to all applications required for your professional and personal digital life.
* No need for manipulative marketing: you can find anything for free and you can promote everything for free.
* You can safely communicate with the world.
* You can freely exchange anything for anything else (money for goods, goods for goods, money for money, etc.).

The decentralized Internet like you co-own a super computer which gives yous unlimited access to advanced digital experiences in super high quality, such as augmented reality (education, shopping, …), virtual reality (online meetings, travel, concerts, …), metaverse (a metaverse owned by you), and more.
