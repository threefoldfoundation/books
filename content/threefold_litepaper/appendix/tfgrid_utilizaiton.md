Our challenge at the present time is not generating sales opportunities, it is scaling execution capability to expand the grid and deliver on the projects which are in front of us, each week brings yet another significant new opportunity. However, through decentralization, improved documentation, roadshows and promotion we will scale up very quickly over the next few years.
