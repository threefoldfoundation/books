Zero-OS (see further) is used on the 3Nodes and provides the base layer with storage, compute & network capacity. 

 \
The Twins are a new development paradigm for building ultra scalable & sovereign internet dapps of the future, we use this ourselves to deploy the projects we are doing with large banks and some countries who are ready for a more regenerative internet future for their citizens.

Thanks to our Smart Contract of IT layer you can still use industry standard tools like kubernetes, helm, terraform, â€¦ to deploy any workload you would want, our solution is compatible with anything which can run on linux our additional storage and network primitives provide additional benefits.
