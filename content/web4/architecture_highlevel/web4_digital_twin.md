### Experiences

Developers create Experiences using the twin capabilities, not apps. 

Experiences re-use the same capabilities.

This has huge benefits

- a lot less development effort needed per experience
- more sustainable (less energy loss)
- easier for user, no duplication
- more simplicy
- more powerful
