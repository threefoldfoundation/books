# Web 4.0 Digital Twin

Our web4 Digital Twin architecture puts the user central. The Digital Twin is a special mode of our TF Executor concept.

Each user has a private secure executor running which we call a digital twin.

Every user uses any browser to access their digital twin. Our TFCONNECT makes sure that the connection is secure.

The secure browser engine runs on the TFGrid close to where your Twin is.

This takes care of a very secure approach and unlimited scalability.

The twin has basic capabilities which are strongly version controlled, but contributions from the global community are more than welcome.

The idea is to create a system which is simply good enough for any possible experience.

Rather than survival of the fittest, we believe in a system of collaboration, where we invite everyone to make the system better so it fits us all. We don't need three chat systems, we need one which is usable by thousands of experiences.

Developers create Experiences on top, not apps. Experiences re-use the same capabilities.

This has huge benefits

- 10x less engineering effort needed per experience
- more sustainable (less energy loss)
- easier for user, no duplication
- more simplicy
- more powerful
