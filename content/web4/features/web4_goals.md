# Web 4 Goals

- 10x faster development efficiency should be possible
    - One Language to do all (smart contract, backend, frontend, logic â€¦)
    - Easy to read & learn (few ways how to do things)
    - Leads to less security issues and lower maintenance cost
- Resolve the onion issue
    - Solutions grow exponentially in complexity as they grow, Web 4 resolves this
- No Painkiller Approach (resolve the root   of the problem)
    - Governments or Large Enterprises want one digital backbone system to resolve all their needs 
    -Today they have too many systems and it's too complex, expensive and not secure
- Ultimate Scale
    - We want to be able to grow to billions of users, our system is 100% scale out
    - Our smart contract for IT allows deployment of any web 2,3 and 4 workload everywhere
- Ultimate Sovereignity
    - Governments want all data in the country and their independence
- Antidote for the Cyber Pandemic
    - This is a very hard one, the current architectures are very vulnerable
    - The ThreeFold architecture allows for a real end2end solution 
    - We have e.g. browser virtualization technology (run no javascript in existing browsers)
