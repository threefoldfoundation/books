# Peer2Peer Reputation System 

Reputation is a very important part to any financial system. This allows users to see the reputation of the people they are transacting or doing business with.

We are developing a unique peer2peer reputation system to allow the power of network effects to come up with strong verification and reputation proofs. We think this might become an important added value that any financial institution  government could deliver to its customers/citizens.
