# Proof of Authenticity

Proof of Authenticity (PoA) is an algorithm that allows peers to verify that people, products and statements on the ThreeFold Grid are genuine. It acts as a reputation engine to validate any information on the grid. 

## Why Proof of Authenticity

Any system that contains a vast amount of information, should require proof of authenticity.

We believe users should be able to measure authenticity in relation to

- The people they connect with;
- The products and services they access;
- The information they consume.

Therefore, to automate information search in a decentralized and trustful environemnt, an algorithm that is able to scale information verification in a neutral way is required. 

Proof of authenticity puts forward a very simple method to verify the genuiness of information.

Here's an example of how PoA works in a decentralized context:

- Someone fills in their profile with their personal and professional data. 
- A former colleague finds their information and verifies their information as being authentic. 
- Once a user gets verified e.g. 10 times, they can be trusted to be real and genuine. 

The above can also apply to products, statements and more. In that sense, PoA can solve multiple digital challenges such as:

- The verifiability of information and news 
- A non-biased way to rate products and services. 
- website authenticity 
- etc.

## Applicability

POA can be used for any type of information but one of the first ones is identity, KYC/AML is a mechanism to identify people but peer authentication is a very powerful way to extend this with.
