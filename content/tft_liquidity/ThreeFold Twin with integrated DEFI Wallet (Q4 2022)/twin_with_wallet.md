# ThreeFold Twin with integrated DEFI Wallet (Q4 2022)

![image alt text](img/wallet_infographic.png)

We are launching our Digital Twin (FreeFlow-Uhuru) at the end of summer 2022 and by the end of the year latest Q1 2023 our Digital Twin will have true decentralized finance capabilities.

Imagine your twin is your personal trading and exchange bot, you would become the exchange. You instruct your twin with e.g. I want to buy TFT at a maximum price of X, if that does not work in a certain time then pay 20% more. Now the twin on your behalf will talk with the other twins and the connected blockchain systems to see if a deal can be made and on your behalf get the best possible price. This twin doesnâ€™t have to sleep and can work nonstop until your required result has been achieved. We can even implement personal liquidity pool functionality, so you can make some gain by providing liquidity to others.

* The minimum price will be defined by the DAO but not lower than 0.15 USD.
* People can define min price to sell, max price to buy and duration of their offer
* The order books are not visible, this makes it much harder for bots to manipulate the price and volume. 
* The process is managed by your digital twin also a peer2peer defi system.
* The digital twin will also try to use above mentioned liquidity pools and optionally exchanges on your behalf.
* Each successful peer2peer exchange transaction gets registered in the blockchain, 
This way we have a market defined price really based on supply and demand.

The wallet would use our TF Connect security layer and needs to be the easiest possible wallet to use, we would work with 3e parties to make it easy to use FIAT currency as well to enter this system.

We would like to offer this functionality to other crypto projects as well, as long as they create liquidity pools with TFT as pair (-: 
We believe this is a very important missing piece for a more sustainable decentralized and safe digital currency world.

This system is not limited to only digital currencies but you can use the twin to find any good or service you are looking for as well as exchange any good/service for any digital currency/token. The twin will take care of all details.

We are working on some huge projects with millions of users who need this functionality (banks & countries).
The concept of having your own twin which acts on your behalf we call web 4.0.

    **DISCLAIMER: this is no investment advice, we do not promise any financial benefit 
    and we do ****not**** suggest or promise any future TFT price.**
