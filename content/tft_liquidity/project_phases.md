# ThreeFold Project Phases
![image alt text](img/TF_project_phases_graph.png )

The first phase has been focused on initial expansion and the creation of all the technology required (this is now completed). The next two phases are all about accelerated expansion, and this requires many billions of tokens and tens of thousands of servers, neither of which are available today. 

## Phase 1 = The Creation & Initial Roll out Phase (Completed)

* Creation of the ThreeFold Grid, rewards for all early farmers & technology providers. +50m USD invested.
* Initial roll out, Proof of technology (we are now gen 3), every day new capacity is extended without our involvement.

## Phase 2 = Expansion Phase = Requires X Billion TFT = STAKING FOR EXPANSION

* This stage will need multiple billions of TFT, this will stabilize the TFT price & drive liquidity.
* Meanwhile the world is becoming less stable, more and more people realize they need a new Internet and more stable digital currency. Because of the underlying tokenomics, TFT might be a good future inflation hedge.

## Phase 3 = Web 4.0 Roll out = lots of utilization on TFGrid will be required

* A first roll out for web 4.0 will be called Freeflow (Uhuru) , our alternative to +10 digital experiences.
* We are working on some big projects with huge communities which want to onboard our FreeFlow concept, some NEO banks as well as countries. This can lead to millions of twins which will lead to real utilization of the grid.
* Is in parallel with phase 2.

## Phase 4 = Velocity Phase = the engine is running at full speed = the world has a new internet (-:

* TFT is needed everywhere to get access to 
    * Web 4.0 - hundreds of millions of twins
    * TFGrid Internet Capacity 
    * Rendering & Streaming capacity for Gaming & Metaverse Capacity (this will be HUGE)
    * DEFI Pools for more P2P currencies
* This will lead to increased velocity and flow, this is how a valuable digital currency is being created
* As part of this phase we burn (take out of circulation) more tokens than we create because of our burning concept.

*For Phase 2 and 3, we would require +100 Billion of TFT if the TFT price were not to rise from current absurdly low prices, there is simply nowhere near enough TFT available so the TFT price must rise as a consequence.*
