# FAQ

## I like what I see, how do I take action?

Contact us, we will help you to get on the liquidity pool or acquire a validator and start your own Internet of Internets.

## How do you see the future of crypto?

We believe it will be great but just like in the dot com crash, some correction is needed.

## How important are centralized exchanges these days?

These days it's not really needed any longer to list on big exchanges , see an article Kristof wrote recently [https://medium.com/@despiegk/crypto-is-dead-long-live-crypto-c3d1d774630c](https://medium.com/@despiegk/crypto-is-dead-long-live-crypto-c3d1d774630c) 

Ecosystems like Algorand and Stellar are amazing and have everything required to let us grow our token organically.

We are 100% compatible with market standards today like order book exchange and AMM Defi Pool (on stellar and on algorand, defi pool on algorand). Everything we use from echanges is natively available on modern blockchains these days, we support them on 2 major platforms.

## Is the grid usable?

Of course it is, people are expanding & using the grid today. See [https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#/manual3_home_new](https://library.threefold.me/info/manual/#//manual__manual3_home_new) how to get started. Today everything which can run on linux can run on the cloud.

Of course there are some known (non blocking) issues

* The UI is not user friendly enough (will be fixed in next release).
* The documentation needs improvement
* We donâ€™t have enough IP addresses (being resolved)
* We also need to be more clear about farming quality definition & measurement, 
it needs to be easier for people to define what a good farmer is.

Is the system good enough

* We believe so, if not let us know why not and what we need to improve.

We keep on working on improvements to of course address above, but first priority is on tools to do with VALIDATORS and FARMING and our DAO, this is the first requirement now.

The TFGrid has been fully functional since the start of this year in version 3.0. We have chosen to keep the Grid in an Alpha/Beta state for now, Google did this for years. There is an operational devnet, testnet and mainnet.

Version 4.0 is the version where we roll out support for the Regional Internet support.

We are launching end user facing projects like Uhuru over summer who have the potential to bring millions of users.

## What is your future plan for your financial ecosystem?

We are partnering with a project which is creating a regulated licensed 3 party financial system, in a whitelisted country without exchange control (means money can freely go in/out) with full support of the government.

* The **digital bank **allows for a personal bridge between digital twin, fiat, credit cards & digital assets.
* The **custodial bank** allows us to create and hold any digital assets (tokens) on behalf of our users.
* The **exchange** allows us to exchange regulated between any asset class in safe ways

The 3 financial institutions will be relying on threefold digital twin technology (web 4) and as such offer a super safe, sovereign, powerful but easy to use experience.

This is a huge opportunity for ourselves and our partners. We can help any partner crypto or digital currency project to allow people to work with their tokens in a fully regulated way.

This is becoming very important because certain crypto friendly areas are becoming greylisted like the UAE (see [https://complyadvantage.com/insights/fatf-blacklists-greylists/](https://complyadvantage.com/insights/fatf-blacklists-greylists/)) .

Our bank will be based in Mauritius which has no exchange control, is whitelisted and has lots of double tax treaties in place. More info see [https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/mauritius-trade-financing](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/mauritius-trade-financing)
