# This Is Our Moment

the world needs decentralization now more than ever, crypto is re-inventing itself 
> just like what happened in the dot.com crash, this is the ideal moment to break through.

## We were preparing for this moment:

* Product ready, and good enough (yes)
* First traction for large projects which many users (yes)
* Community traction proven (yes)
* Ready to go viral (cheapest and only way it can work in a down market) (some more work)
* A team and core community capable to execute which is lean & mean (yes)
* A lot of cash on the bank, so it's easier to break through (not yet)
* Good values in place, and ready for the future (planet/people first model) (yes)
* Governance (working on DAO)

## Our values/strategy reminded:

* Right mix of Planet, People, Profit (no profit without taking care of planet and people on it)
* We will not do pump/dump, we will not do fake market making
* We will not do big marketing unless we get the right funding and now exactly who to target and when/why.
* We need product to be ready for the world (that's why we kept on pushing and we are there now)
* We should not do things which we can’t do yet (don’t run before you can walk, e.g. going too operational with the Grid we can’t we dont have the team nor funding for it, we are now fundraising to make this happen).

## Next steps

* Fundraise to support global expansion as well as support community building (promotion, events, …)
* Expansion phase (get hundreds of thousands of nodes on the TFGrid as well as many regional internets)
* Launch first big usecases e.g. freeflow/uhuru (our digital twin)
* Deliver some of the big projects (millions of users)

## We are a startup and community based organization

* Which means we have to improvise, we need to see what works and what doesn’t
* Of course we make mistakes, but because we are flexible and we listen we can always adjust fast

> **We have done this 2x before in previous projects , and planned for this, 
> It's time to move & be one of the leaders of a new era.**
