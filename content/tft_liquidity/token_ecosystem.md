# TFT Financial Token Ecosystem

![image alt text](img/TFT_ecosystem_infographic.png )

It's no longer needed for a currency like TFT to be on a centralized exchange, everything they have to offer is available on these modern money blockchain ecosystems like Stellar & Algorand. It’s incredible to see how mature these platforms became. The process is actually getting very easy. 

## Benefits today:

* Availability of stable coins (gold, usdc, …). The ability to use physical gold as an example is amazing.
* Easy ways to exchange currencies against each other, there is support for automatic DEFI exchange as well as orderbook based exchange built into Algorand & Stellar. Some of the wallets are super easy to use and make it easy for users to exchange their TFT for other digital currencies like USDC.
* Easy onramp with debit/credit cards (upto couple of thousand of USD).
* If you want to work with larger budgets, you have to choose your onboarding platform (can be a CEX, but there are also specialized services doing just this), do your KYC and send the money to that platform. Once on board the digital currency e.g. USDC can easily be transferred to your wallet on Stellar or Algorand.
* Once in the digital realm, your life becomes so much easier. Transferring or exchanging money becomes super easy and more reliable, the transaction fees on Stellar and Algorand are super low, the transaction happens immediately, you get full transparency when doing an exchange on the chosen DEX. Using a centralized exchange is much more complicated and dangerous.
* Your digital assets are potentially much safer compared to a bank or central exchange. Most banks do play with your money which means you cannot be sure that you will never lose it. Central exchanges, well… don’t get me started, most of them are even much worse compared to a bank, and many have very poor moral standards. There are some good exchanges of course, but only use them when you need them e.g. they can be good to find more liquidity for certain popular currency pairs or as an on/off ramp of your digital assets.

We are working on a new set of manuals to make it easier for people to understand how to use this ecosystem.
