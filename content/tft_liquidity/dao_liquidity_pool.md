# DAO based TFT Liquidity Pool (Q1 2023)

![image alt text](img/TFT_liquidity_pool_infographic.png )

There are +-40m USD worth TFT, from which a small minority is liquid, there are billions of TFT required (see [litepaper](http://litepaper.threefold.me) and scarcity simulator below) this will lead to upward price pressure. We believe in organic growth of our token.

The liquidity on the exchanges (even on Algorand or Stellar) is low, this leads to inability for people who want to buy a lot of TFT, we donâ€™t feel comfortable using commercial liquidity providers, we would rather work with our community and have our own community funded decentralized liquidity pool.

We are in the process of establishing a community based liquidity pool (additional to the DEFI pool of today):

* This liquidity pool is funded by USDC and TFT (and maybe a gold token).
* The min price the TFT will sell for from this pool is DAO defined price e.g. 0.15 USD 
* This is a DAO based liquidity pool, the TFT price and the spread 33% at start is voted on a weekly basis.
* TFT to USDC will be 33% lower price compared to USDC/PAXG to TFT. 
This 33% margin is fully added to the liquidity pool, this means the liquidity pool constantly grows in value (this is the margin for the liquidity pool providers), this is very unique.

    and we do ****not**** suggest or promise any future TFT price.**
