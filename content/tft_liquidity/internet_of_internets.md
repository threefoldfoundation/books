# Internet of Internets Concept Provides Planetary Scale

![image alt text](img/internet_of_internets_header.png )

The Internet of Internets system has one Mother DAI (Decentralized Autonomous Internet), which supports lots of regional Internets protected by Daughter DAIs. Each Regional Internet supports unlimited Community and Neighborhood Clouds which provide the Internet Experiences and Capacity (storage, compute) for its local users.

This provides for a scalable internet infrastructure which can scale to billions of people.

Community or Neighborhood Clouds are the foundation of this model, each of them providing all the required tools and applications for equal access to knowledge, education, business, financial systems, collaboration, communication and experiences for the community to thrive. A Community or Neighborhood Cloud is owned by its community members and provides for a completely decentralized Internet, by the people, for the people. Our Internet. Your Internet. 

The specific case of Neighborhood Clouds (defined as a deployment whereby ThreeFold Internet Capacity is deployed as part of a real estate project) is a good way to expand the Internet of Internets for the following reasons.

* The quality of computer hardware and associated equipment is high, reliable and well optimized 
* We can optimize the connectivity (e.g. fiber) and the operations cost is super low (power is free, zero data center cost)
* We can help emerging countries faster, they have many real estate projects being built.
* Utilization is built in, because the community will use the grid as well as government departments or surrounding businesses, and there is vested interest for the community to promote their Neighborhood Cloud.
* It's highly decentralized, each project is independent.
* A part of the funds received from a Neighborhood cloud can be used to support the TFT price.
