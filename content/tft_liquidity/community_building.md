# Expansion of our community building activities

Next year, we want to organize a ThreeFold Caravan of Light. 

A series of "plant the flag" events, starting in the US and Latin America where a group of people as a caravan of light go to places to plant a flag for a new internet.

This will happen by means of knowledge sharing motivational events combined with music and dance. For this we have support from an amazing team which is called Caravan of Light. It's a beautiful group of talented event organizers and network of artists.

We have now done a couple of events and it's incredible and very effective.

We will also continue our events on the Nile, 2 maximum 3 times per year we come together on the Nile expanding our community.

So far each event has been amazing accelerators for our growth, we just need to do it more and more organized, this in our opinion is the best spend marketing budget, it's much more concrete and allows a solid community to be born.

Community is what we are, this is the most solid foundation for our project to grow on. We are and need to be a globally happy connected family who chose to go out of victimhood and make change happen.

These events do cost money, but we believe they are the absolute most effective way to build community.
