# TFT Scarcity Simulator

We have created a simulator in which people can simulate how the Internet of Internets strategy needs billions of TFT which are not there yet. This simulator allows you to simulate the relation between size of grid and token scarcity.

In this simulation it's easy to see how many TFT we need depending on the token price, if the price is only 0.2 we need +4 billion tokens which are not available so in other words, the TFT price needs to be higher to be able this way people need to buy less TFT for their validators and twins. If we put the price on 4 it just works:

    disclaimer: we are not making any promise about any token price of grid size, 
    it's up to you to make your own assessment. TFT is not an investment instrument.
