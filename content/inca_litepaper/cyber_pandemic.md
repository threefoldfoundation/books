Countries have a hard time to defend themselves against cyber security threats, the main issue is that technology available might come from compromised sources in the first place. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? Lots of issues have never been intended but because of history we now end up with IT infrastructure which is incredibly hard to make secure.

EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND OUTDATED A NEW APPROACH IS NEEDED.
