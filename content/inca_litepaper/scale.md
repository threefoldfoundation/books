Each Regional Internet is created by a Genesis Farmer (a genesis farmer can be a local or federal government or tribe, but also a property development company,  university or even an Enterprise) who will look for investors who will receive INCA tokens in return for their investment. The INCA Certificates are a regulated investment instrument also registered on the blockchain and are structured as Sukuk certificates.

Each Genesis Farmer and its investors will deploy 50 Validators for the regional Internet and will fund a liquidity pool, this is a pool for making exchange between TFT and CHI easy and fluid.
