# EDGE INCA GENERATORS AS COMPLEMENT TO CENTRALIZED DATACENTERS

INCA stands for INternet CApacity (storage, compute and network) and is today mainly delivered from out of large centralized datacenters, which were and still are fundamental for the further internet growth, but this is not enough; we believe they need to be complemented by quantum safe edge datacenters.

**together we can deliver an decentralized internet capacity datacenter approach which is more:**

* safe
* war proof (see what happened with Ukraine), we are much more decentralized.
* scalable (billions of users are possible)
* more bandwidth efficient (closer to where the users are)
* cost effective and green
* potentially carbon neutral
