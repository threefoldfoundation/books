A Sukuk ("Sharia-compliant" bond) is an Islamic financial certificate that represents a portion of ownership in a portfolio of eligible existing or future assets. The INCA is technically created as a digital token (also called NFT) which represents value and is unique.

The INCA Certificates are transferable through blockchain technology.

Each INCA Certificate represents a certain amount of Internet Capacity value and is backed by guarantees.

Each INCA is linked to the following Certificate Properties

* The generator of the CHIs = the farmer who will convert INCA to CHI
* The conditions of this conversion (nr of CHI per INCA), from which date.
* The guarantees of this INCA e.g. the farmer uses their shares and assets as backing for the value of the INCA, so in case the INCA cannot be converted to the right amount of CHI at the right value the INCA owner has the option to convert into shares or demand FIAT currency.

All of this happens in an automated way by blockchain technology but can also be legally backed by contractual documents between the INCA Investor and the Farmer.
