# QUANTUM SAFE EDGE DATACENTER CONCEPT

ThreeFold has created super efficient **IN**ternet **CA**pacity generation technology. This INternet CApacity is compute, storage and network capacity which is green, secure, sovereign and private. This capacity layer is compatible with +- all workloads which would otherwise run in a centralized datacenter.

The 3Nodes are the efficient INCA generators and can be deployed in homes, offices, buildings, parking spots or deep down in basements or even vaults or bunkers. This allows for the creation of a super secure decentralized datacenter approach.

A node can be as small as a 1.000 USD cost box or as expensive as 50.000 USD per node.

The nodes can be connected over a multitude of networking technologies and even a combination, our technology is capable of looking for the shortest path in relation to connectivity on top of existing infrastructure. The network layer inside a Quantum Safe Virtual Datacenter is end2end encrypted and private. If somewhere an internet connectivity path is broken, the technology will look for alternative paths automatically, this happens without having to use Internet Routing protocols which might be too slow and possibly not secure enough.

## Scalable INCA Super Node Approach

The Edge datacenter concept is able to create and deliver mainstream datacenter services from non datacenter locations, at the so called edge.  However at the edge there might not be all the needed (technical) components to create and operate internet services equal to what can be done in the super nodes.

There are 3 major parts to it

* Zero-OS = our own low level operating system providing compute capabilities
* Quantum Safe Storage System
* Planetary Network = an overlay end2end encrypted network layer
