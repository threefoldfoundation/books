# Weblets

Weblets are a UI tool helps to deploy solutions on TF Grid v3.

A weblet is a compiled javascript web component which can be embedded in HTML page of a web app.

The backend for the weblets is introduced with [grid client](../javascript/grid3_javascript_readme.md) which communicate to TF Chain and TF Grid over RMB.

## Limitations

- Regarding browser support, we're only supporting Google Chrome browser at the moment with more browsers to be supported soon. 
- Deploys one thing at a time.
- Might take sometime to deploy a solution like Peertube, so you should wait a little bit until it's fully running.
