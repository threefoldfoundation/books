- Enter an Application Name. It's used in generating a unique subdomain on one of the gateways on the network alongside your twin ID. Ex. ***dc98newdisc*.gent02.dev.grid.tf**

- Enter administrator information including **Email**. This admin will have full permission on the deployed instance.

- Select a capacity package:
    - **Minimum**: {cpu: 1, memory: 1024 * 2, diskSize: 10 }
    - **Standard**: {cpu: 2, memory: 1024 * 2, diskSize: 50 }
    - **Recommended**: {cpu: 4, memory: 1024 * 4, diskSize: 100 }
    - Or choose a **Custom** plan
- Choose a gateway node to deploy your Discourse instance on.

- Select a node to deploy your Discourse instance on.

    - Either use the **Capacity Filter**. Which simply lets you pick a *Farm* and *Country*, after clicking on *Apply filters and suggest nodes* then it lists available nodes with these preferences and you pick.


    - Or use **Manual** and type a specific node number to deploy on.


Unlike other solutions, Discourse requires that you have an SMTP server. So make sure you fill the fields in the **Mail Server** tab in order to deploy your instance successfully.
