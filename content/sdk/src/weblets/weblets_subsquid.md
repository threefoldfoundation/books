- Select a capacity package:
    - **Minimum**: { cpu: 1, memory: 1024 , diskSize: 50 }
    - **Standard**: { cpu: 2, memory: 1024 * 2, diskSize: 100 }
    - **Recommended**: { cpu: 4, memory: 1024 * 4, diskSize: 250 }
    - Or choose a **Custom** plan
- Choose a gateway node to deploy your Subsquid instance on.

  
- Choose a node to deploy your Subsquid instance on.

    - Either use the **Capacity Filter** which simply lets you pick a *Farm* and *Country*, after clicking on *Apply filters and suggest nodes* then it lists available nodes with these preferences and you pick.

    - Or use **Manual** and type a specific node number to deploy on.

After that is done you can see a list of all of your deployed instances
