    - **Minimum**: {cpu: 1, memory: 1024 * 4, diskSize: 100 }
    - **Standard**: {cpu: 2, memory: 1024 * 16, diskSize: 500 }
    - **Recommended**: {cpu: 4, memory: 1024 * 32, diskSize: 1000 }
    - Or choose a **Custom** plan
- Choose a gateway node to deploy your CasperLabs instance on.

    - Either use the **Capacity Filter**. Which simply lets you pick a *Farm* and *Country*, after clicking on *Apply filters and suggest nodes* then it lists available nodes with these preferences and you pick.
