# TF-Chain Portal Transfer

## Transfer TFT between TFChain accounts

The portal can be used to transfer TFTs between 2 accounts that exist on the same chain.

> Remark: testnet and mainnet both have the same TFTs but as the 2 chains are different, there is no way to do a direct transfer between accounts on testnet and on mainnet.
