## **Africa is a target, and is being taken over…**

Africa is super rich in natural resources (food, water, minerals, gold, …). Some large countries seem to do everything they can to destabilize Africa to allow them to extract even more.

Example, why are countries like Tanzania, one of the richest in the world for natural resources, still having one of the lowest GDP per capita?  A reason might be that Tanzania is being taken advantage of?

In the case of Tanzania, we are still lucky that there is a stable government with strong leaders,  a vision and good will to improve their country, but some other countries in Africa are not that lucky.

In our personal opinion the 3 main tools which make this possible are:

- Investment deals, putting countries in debt, and giving power to external parties.
- Mass scale, manipulation of internet information (in case of country take over, coup d’etat).
- Corruption = greed, leads to unfair deals for the country.

We see right now, there are geo-political movements happening. The big 3 are dividing Africa over themselves to secure their own future.

We believe information manipulation (cyber warfare, psychological info manipulation) is a requirement and the easiest way to make this possible.
