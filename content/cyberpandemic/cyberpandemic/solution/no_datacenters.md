## Use Datacenters Carefully

Datacenters are and will be the first point of attack in a conflict situation, even countries like Ukraine only had 4-5 good datacenters which needed to be taken with disaster results. Next to physical violence Datacenters can be attacked over the network too or through insiders. Centralization is not a good strategy for securing your most valuable assets. 

While Datacenters are potentially required for certain high end compute requirements, they are for sure not needed for storage and alternative strategies can be created for most compute workloads as well.

If Datacenters are a must we would recommend to build small ones and have them spread over the country on at least 10 strategic locations and have good strategies in place to deal with data distribution (don't use replication, see below)
