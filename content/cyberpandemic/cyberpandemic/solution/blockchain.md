### Use a blockchain based identity and authentication management system

Using a blockchain for managing identity and authentication.

A digital ledger is a good base to store information about users, groups and their access rights, proper “smart contracts” can be used to let the right people define security clearance levels and group access.

Don’t give the power of this to administrators, consensus needs to be implemented to allow management of groups & rights by itself. Consensus between required instances is a very important element to create a strongly identifiable and authenticated security access layer.
