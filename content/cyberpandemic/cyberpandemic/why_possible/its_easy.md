## **It's easy to hack, using existing vulnerabilities**

Info can be found on the internet and can be done by not even serious experts.

- e.g. a [youtube training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgM-_42rWbM).
- e.g. on [medium](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/creating-windows-os-backdoor-with-msfvenom-ba56567eb088).
- Other: [example](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Nearly-Undetectable-Backdoor-using-MSFvenom-in-Kali-Linux).

I just found these in 2 min google search, it's actually all quite simple and effective.

Sometimes it requires some social engineering or getting people on fake websites but it's a lot less difficult than people might think and it's actually hard to protect against using existing off the shelf components. e.g. firewalls do not help.

Iâ€™ve seen kids doing this and even enjoying it because of the feeling of empowerment it gives them.
