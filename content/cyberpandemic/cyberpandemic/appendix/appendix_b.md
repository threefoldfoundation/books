# **Appendix B: some examples of vulnerability information**

While the next list is only the tip of the iceberg, it shows there is more at stake than we might have imagined. Backdoors are everywhere and have become a part of our life.

The issue is not that they are there, it's how they opened up our infrastructure to so many parties out there who use those “vulnerabilities” to get access to our information. Like a real pandemic it's now +- impossible to stop.

Backdoors in technology products.

Things to think about:



* Intel buys McAfee, which is installed on so many computers as antivirus software which by design has access to all information on your computer.

Wikileaks:



* Is a powerful source of information, the craziest part is, it's not even denied to be true. 
* To us it's crazy that this information is ignored for the most part,  \
a lot can be learned of how vulnerable we are.
* Some simple starting point: [https://wikileaks.org/vault7](https://wikileaks.org/vault7/) , but there is so much more
