# **Appendix C: should we be paranoid?**

We always need to keep in mind what is there to be hacked.
What damage can be done if someone would have access?
Sometimes the best security is just to be open and not hide at all, then there is nothing to be stolen nor compromised.
But donâ€™t be mistaken if any of your strategic people or assets becomes a target. We believe hacking will succeed. Current security practices in most (+-all) countries are not sufficient.
