## **Use open source software as much as possible.**

Hire people who are fluent with open-source software, do everything in an open manner. If security is really important then make sure your team can read and validate the code used.

Often such code needs to be extended and integrated with a centralized blockchain based identity and authentication management system (see below).

Code needs to be built in house with experts and cross-building strategies can be done to make sure that no backdoors are inserted while building (compiling) the software, best would be to integrate this with “infrastructure as code” approach (see above).

PS: opensource software does not mean free, there is a cost involved in maintaining, improving such systems in line to requirements of a government or company. This can be an outsourced or internal approach. Very good knowledge is required to make such a strategy successful, and this is often an issue.

We suggest using software which is managed by people with knowledge, which often means paying a license fee, but demand the software is open source and understood by people under your control.
