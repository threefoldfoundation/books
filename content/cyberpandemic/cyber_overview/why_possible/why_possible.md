At one point in time, we worked with a large bank, we heard from an insider that they were losing sometimes more than 100m USD on security-related issues and would never admit this or even be open about it. It was just not possible for them to do so, otherwise, they could lose the trust of their customers.

Its really a crazy world out there, the cyberpandemic is real.

This section tries to show you some of the issues to deal with.
