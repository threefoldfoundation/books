# Get Started

Now that you have successfully installed Zola on your machine. You are ready to create and build your own website using ThreeFold Website Tool. 

In order to do that you would need to clone [**ThreeFold's Website Template**](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_examplezola) to your own github account, and open it locally on your computer by using VS Code or your code editing program of choice.

## Clone ThreeFold's Website Template

Our Team has especially created an html/css/markdown based template repository on github, free for anyone to use. To start working on your project, simply fork /clone [this repository](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_examplezola) to your own github account.

## Open and edit your Zola Template on code editor
Once the template is forked and cloned, open your code editor and start working on your website. I will explain a little more about the content editing process and procedure on the next pages...
