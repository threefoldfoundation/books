## ThreeFold_Token: liquidity

ThreeFold_Token (TFT), is a young vibrant token, with the potential to become a leading cryptocurrency with market capitalization of US$1+ billion and daily trading volume of over US$10 million. It is the token of a new neutral green internet, backed by internet capacity, with its own intrinsic value.

One of the keys to success and wide acceptance of the token is its liquidity. Therefore, there is a need to now jump start liquidity as a key to fulfilling TFT's potential. To that extent, we are listing on several major independent token/coin exchanges, as well as launching our own decentralized exchange.

Our first step was to list TFTs on the BTC-Alpha token exchange in June 17, 2018. In the initial weeks of trading, organic daily liquidity rose to more than 10x, with the help of several independent traders who were allocated modest amounts of TFTs to trade. Their mandate was to trade tokens, and they were rewarded based on volume traded. We are considering furthering this as a part of our token promotion efforts.

Step two is to launch our own decentralized exchange, the UI/UX for which is under development and is due to launch in September 2018. The advantage of this decentralized exchange is that there are no trading fees, those typically charged by centralized exchanges. We use atomic swaps to achieve secure and reliable trading across multiple tokens.
Step three is to list TFT on larger, more recognized exchanges. This requires yet higher liquidity i.e. more than 100k USD traded daily, as well as a hefty listing fee. New listings would enable further visibility, liquidity and adoption of TFT's by a significantly larger community.

We would like to take this opportunity to invite all independent traders to engage with our token, TFT. Your participation supports the stability and liquidity of the TFT ecosystem, thereby contributing and empowering the new neutral and sustainable internet which is supported by ThreeFold_Token.
