# Vesting Pool

ThreeFold has implemented a vesting pool over 48 months.

## ThreeFold Vesting 

The vesting pool was designed so that tokens get unlocked according to two factors; time (month) and the token value. Every month, 1/48 of the tokens unlock. Also, once the price goes above a certain amount, more tokens unlock. See the table below.

| description                          |          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Number of TFT unlock per month       | 1/48     |
| Start unlock from                    | 0.1 USD  |
| Start accelerated unlock from        | 0.15 USD |
| Full unlock from (100% acceleration) | 0.85 USD |

The Vesting mechanism was launched in April 2021 and the unlocking of tokens will start in May 2021 (Month 1).

> *TFT price used to release the vested tokens is calculated by the pricing oracle. The pricing orcale uses the average price over the last month as pulled from multiple decentralized exchanges who have a public api to do so. We* **DO NOT** *use the price as shown on one single exchange or other pricing venues such as: Coingecko, Coinmarketcap, etc.*

## Accelerated Vesting Table

The percentage is the amount of tokens which will be unlocked at that month and price level indicated. Column one is for month 0, column 2 for month 9.

## Is Vesting right for me?

If you are an ardent believer in the ThreeFold Project and you see the long-term value, then the answer should come to you fairly easily. By Vesting your TFTs, you give a vote of confidence to the project as this will reduce the supply of tokens and permit the token ecosystem to grow organically. 

ThreeFold does not believe in meddling with the natural course of demand and supply and hence we have made the vesting scheme completely voluntary.

If you are in for the long run, then by vesting your tokens (which you would probably hold on to in the long run) you're basically saying that you will not sell your tokens at the current price. Instead of keeping this knowledge to yourself you're also announcing it to the whole Threefold community and the world.
