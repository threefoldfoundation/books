The info block contains following info : 
`TFT Wallet Address` is the public address of your wallet holding TFTs before vesting. 

`Vesting Account Address` is the public address of the account that will hold the vested tokens. 

At creation, the `Vested TFT` amount will start with zero. 

#### Step 3: Scan the QR code of the vesting account using your Threefold Connect app to deposit TFTs onto the vesting account.
Fill in the amount of TFTs in your wallet, and confirm. Leave 0.01 TFT in your old wallet (transfer fee).
Once the transfer is done, your TFTs are vested (see [Vesting Pool](vesting_pool) for more info). 

In the dashboard, you can check for all vesting transactions that happened (`CHECK TRANSACTIONS` button).
