# Buy from BTC-Alpha

BTC-Alpha was the first cryptocurrency exchange to support ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT).

### How to Register

Registration to the [BTC-Alpha](http://btc-alpha.com) exchange is simple, you only need to provide your email address and a password, so no complex verification procedures required.

To register, go to their [Sign Up](https://btc-alpha.com/accounts/register) page:

### Verify your identity

In the menu underneath your name, you'll see an option for [verification](https://btc-alpha.com/en/profile/verification).

You've already passed email verification (level 0) but there are three more levels of verification possible which we would recommend [from both a security standpoint as well as a functionality standpoint](https://medium.com/@BTCAlpha/how-and-why-to-undergo-the-kyc-procedure-29f3b40af80).

1. Personal Information
2. Identity
3. Addresses

The flow is quite easy to follow. If you're having trouble, you can easily find [BTC-Alpha Support](https://btc-alpha.com/en/support) through Zendesk, Email, Telegram, & more.

### Enable two-factor authentication

From a security standpoint, it is highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your BTC-Alpha account.

To do that, first install **Authy** or **Google Authenticator** on your mobile phone:

- [Authy](https://authy.com/download/)
- [Google Authenticator: Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)
- [Google Authenticator: Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)

Then, click under your name (top-right), then "Enable Two-factor Authentication," and go through the process there.

> It is not recommended to keep your funds permanently on a public exchange or use a public exchange as a wallet, because exchanges are more likely to be hacked than your personal wallet.
