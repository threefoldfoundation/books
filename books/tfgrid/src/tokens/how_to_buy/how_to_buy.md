## Withdraw your TFT from Liquid

On August 21, 2022, TFT was delisted from the Liquid Exchange. This means that TFT can no longer be traded on Liquid. More information [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tft-will-be-delisted-on-liquid-what-now-and-what-next/3197). If you are still holding TFT on Liquid (please note we do not recommend storing tokens on a public exchange), you will need to withdraw your TFT and move them to another location. We recommend one of the options [here](threefold_wallets). If you are unsure, the best option is [ThreeFold Connect](threefold_connect).

Please follow Liquid's documentation on how to withdraw crypto [here](https://help.liquid.com/en/articles/2275670-how-to-withdraw-funds-from-my-liquid-account).
