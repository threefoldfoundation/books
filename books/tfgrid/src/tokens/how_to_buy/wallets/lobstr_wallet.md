## Step 2 Creating a new wallet & Funding It

Lobstr will provide all its users with a 30 day loan of 1.5 XLM to activate the account. When you want to start using the Lobstr wallet you will need to fund it and pay back that loan. You can fund with a credit card or send digital currencies to the addresses of your lobstr wallet.

In case you did not buy XLM yet go to this [example manual for coinbase](coinbase_fiat)
