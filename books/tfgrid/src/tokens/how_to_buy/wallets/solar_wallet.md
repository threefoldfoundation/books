You now have an empty Solar wallet.

## Step 4: transfer XLM to your wallet

Example done with Coinbase. In case you did not buy XLM yet go to this [example manual for coinbase](coinbase_fiat)

1. Copy your wallet address from Solar by clicking Receive and clicking on the address or QR Code. (This will copy the address onto your clipboard.)
