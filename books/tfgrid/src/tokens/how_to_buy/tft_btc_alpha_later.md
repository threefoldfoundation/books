# Using BTC-Alpha (Available April 29)

BTC-Alpha was the first online cryptocurrency exchange to support ThreeFold_Tokens (TFT).

They offer the following trading options:

- [TFT-BTC](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_BTC/)
- [TFT-USD](https://btc-alpha.com/exchange/TFT_USD/)

While BTC-Alpha supports buying ThreeFold_Tokens with USD (second option here above), we recommend that you first acquire Bitcoins as indicated in Buy ThreeFold_Tokens from an online exchange, and then exchange Bitcoins for ThreeFold_Tokens (the first option here above).

So once you have acquired Bitcoins, go through following steps to buy and sell ThreeFold_Tokens using BTC-Alpha:

- [Registration](#registration)
- [Login](#login)
- [Enable two-factor authentication](#two-factor)
- [Deposit BTC](#deposit-btc)
- [Exchange](#exchange-panel)
- [Buy TFT](#buy-tft)
- [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw)
- [Deposit TFT](#deposit-tft)

> As indicated here below in the section [Withdraw TFT](#withdraw), we highly recommend that you also install the [ThreeFold App](threefold_app) to keep your ThreeFold_Tokens offline in your ThreeFold App wallet.

## Registration

Registration to the [BTC-Alpha](http://btc-alpha.com) exchange is simple, you only need to provide your email address and a password, so no complex verification procedures required.

## Enable two-factor authentication

> It is not recommended to keep your funds permanently on a public exchange or use a public exchange as a wallet, because exchanges are more likely to be hacked than your personal wallet.

It is highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your BTC-Alpha account.

To do that, first install **Authy** or **Google Authenticator** on your mobile phone: - https://authy.com/download/ - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en - https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8

Then configure 2FA by going through the process on **TWO FACTOR AUTH** page:

## Deposit BTC

First, we will transfer Bitcoins to your BTC wallet at BTC-Alpha, which we will then use to buy TFT.

Here are the steps to transfer Bitcoins into your BTC wallet at BTC-Alpha:

1. From the navigation menu under your profile name, go to the **Finance** section:

![Finance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/btc-alpha-finance-section-300.jpg)

2. Find BTC and click **Deposit**:

3. Copy your Bitcoin address and send your deposit there:

You can use this address from any other online cryptocurrency exchange such as [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com) to transfer Bitcoins to your Bitcoin wallet at BTC-Alpha. If you don't own yet any Bitcoins, you should first register at one of the online cryptocurrency exchanges such as [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com), deposit fiat money and buy Bitcoins.

4. Wait until the transaction is fully processed, this typically takes up to 40 minutes.

## Withdraw TFT

> It is not recommended to keep your ThreeFold_Tokens permanently in an online TFT wallet, as provided by online cryptocurrency exchanges such as BTC-Alpha, because online wallets are more likely to get hacked than offline wallets. Instead, we highly recommended keeping your ThreeFold_Tokens in an offline TFT wallet, such as the one provided with the ThreeFold App.

To withdraw your ThreeFold_Tokens from your online TFT wallet on BTC-Alpha go through the following steps:

1. Make sure you have the ThreeFold app installed as documented in [Token Trade using the ThreeFold App](threefold_app) and have the address of your ThreeFold App wallet copied, as documented in the [Receive tokens](threefold_app) section

2. From the navigation menu under your profile name, go to the **Finance** section:

![Finance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/btc-alpha-finance-section-300.jpg)

3. Locate TFT in the list and click **Withdraw**, and select TFT in the popup list (not BTC-Alpha Codes)

4. In a withdrawal dialog specify the amount of TFT to withdraw and the destination address you got from your TFT wallet in the ThreeFold app:

![Withdraw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/btc-alpha-withdraw.jpg)

## Deposit TFT

1. From the navigation menu under your profile name, again go to the **Finance** section:

![Finance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/btc-alpha-finance-section-300.jpg)

2. Find TFT and click **Deposit**:

![TFT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldfoundation/info_tokens/master/docs/img/btc-alpha-tft-deposit.jpg)
