# BTC Asset on ThreeFold Connect Wallet

The ThreeFold Connect wallet now allows you to buy TFTs using Bitcoin. (BTC Asset)


###  The Purpose of 'BTC Asset' on ThreeFold Connect Wallet

The purpose of activating and having BTC Asset on your ThreeFold Connect Wallet is to make it easier for you as TFT Holder to gain more TFT by depositing BTC into the wallet and trading it into TFT Asset. 

### The Technology Behind BTC-TFT Asset Trades

BTC Asset represents Bitcoin bridged to the Stellar Blockchain. For more information, please check [cryptoanchor.io](https://cryptoanchor.io). 

### Withdrawing your BTC Asset

Withdrawing BTC from the Stellar network comes with transaction fees which are defined by Cryptoanchor. None of the ThreeFold organisations intervenes in this transaction, and ThreeFold has no liability when it comes to holding BTC on the Stellar network. 
The bridging process invokes additional transaction fees from the Bitcoin network. Thus, the fees for withdrawals will likely be higher than for a regular BTC transaction. **Please keep in mind that ThreeFold has no commercial or cooperative relationship with CryptoAnchor.**

### Reminder of our T&C

As a wallet holder, you are the only person that has access to the private keys allowing to generate transactions on the blockchain network. ThreeFold is unable to help you out in case you lose these private keys. Please don't share the app seed phrase nor the Stellar secret of your wallet with anyone. Make a secure backup of them so that you are able to recover your wallet on another device in case your device gets lost or stops functioning. Please read our [terms & conditions](legal:terms_conditions_griduser) to understand further about the liability circumstances of ThreeFold Grid Products and Services users.
