## Transfer BTC to another account

At this point in time, [Cryptoanchor](https://cryptoanchor.io/), the issuer of the BTC trustline on the Stellar network, doesn't support sponsored transfers of tokens as implemented in the ThreeFold Connect app.

BTCs can be withdrawn to another wallet using Interstellar (DEX owned by the issuer of BTC on the Stellar network). 

Here is how to do it:

- First go to detailed info, and press show secret.
- Copy this secret, you will need it later.
- Navigate to [Interstellar Exchange](https://interstellar.exchange/app/#/), follow the steps and select “Enter account”
- Choose a password and login
- Select “Import” a single wallet, fill in the secret you copied earlier.
- You will need a very small amount of XLM to execute this transaction ( 0.0001 ). If you don’t have this XLM or don’t know how to get it, please contact support on https://threefold.io/ with your public wallet address provided.
Click `BTC` and select `Withdraw`.
- Fill in the amount and Bitcoin address you want to withdraw it to. Keep in mind there is a transaction fee, the site might adjust the amount if you don’t have enough in your account to cover both the amount + fee.
- Confirm the transaction.
