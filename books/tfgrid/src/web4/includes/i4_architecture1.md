Developers can program anything on top of the executor (web4 or digital twin). Any javascript framework can be used.

This allows ANYONE to create ANY experience in least amount of effort.


### From Client Server to Peer2Peer

![](img/peer2peer_executors_.jpg)

Peer2peer is the most decentralized way to experience our digital life.

- all executors talk to each other over private secure links
- there is no blockchain involved for the compute, storage & network requirements.
- each executor needs compute, network and storage resources this is managed by L0 Validators.
- The executor (web4 or twin) is the only entity who has control over the resource it requires, its all 100% private and fully peer2peer.
