Imagine a digital world where 

- you are  in full control and all data belongs to you.
- your digital life only needs 1 watt of energy (which is nothing)
- you can communicate with everyone everywhere without worries
- information is authentic
- you have access to unlimited education information


This is what web4 is all about.
