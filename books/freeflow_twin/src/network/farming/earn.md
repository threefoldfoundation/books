- Additional [TFT](/tfgrid/farming/threefold__threefold_token) are farmed to compensate for Carbon and deliver the yield for the Layer 2 Staking pools

## Farming Reward Calculation

Each FreeFlow node has a certain amount of compute, storage and network resources, the reward is calculated as such:

- Compute Capacity (CPU)
- Memory Capacity (RAM)
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)
- Network Capacity (Bandwidth, IP Addresses)
 
> TFT earned per month = 
    CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
    + SU farmed * SU farming rewards
    + NU used * NU farming rewards
    + IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards


For the predefined nodes as defined on the "buy node" page the rewards are fixed and desribed in this manual.
