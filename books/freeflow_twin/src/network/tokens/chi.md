## CHI is scarce

- 5.000 nodes results in 100-150.000.000 CHI over 5 years.
- 5.000 nodes enable +- 250.000 to 500.000 users with their digital life.
- Each user renting a twin needs about 50 CHI to do so, this results in the requirement of 300.000.000 CHI per year (if they would hold it per year).
- 1m users buying FFK's (the twins) at these conditions, results in +-1.000.000.000 CHI.
- Clearly there are not enough CHI's which means the CHI price needs to go up ad the network grows.

## Farming Reward Calculation Details

Each FreeFlow node has a certain amount of compute, storage and network resources, the reward is calculated as such:

- Compute Capacity (CPU)
- Memory Capacity (RAM)
- Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)
- Network Capacity (Bandwidth, IP Addresses)
 
> TFT earned per month = 
    CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
    + SU farmed * SU farming rewards
    + NU used * NU farming rewards
    + IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards

The reward for above items are linked (pegged) to the USD

| Unit                | USD   | Unit                                  |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| Compute Unit (CU)   | 2.4   | per month                             |
| Storage Unit (SU)   | 1     | per month                             |
| Network Unit (NU)   | 0.03  | per GB transfer (as customers use it) |
| Public IPv4 Address | 0.005 | per IP address, calculated per hour   |

For the predefined nodes as defined on the "buy node" page the rewards are fixed and described in this manual and expressed in CHI.

## Important Farming Remarks

- The rewards get expressed in USD and registered in the FreeFlow Blockchain (FFChain) at FreeFlow Node registration time.
- CU/SU rewards are calculated from Resource Units,  see this [doc](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__farming_reward_calculation)
- Rewards for NU and IP Addresses are dynamic
The FFChain tracks capacity utilization and as such the reward can be calculated for the Farmer.
- All Internet capacity farmed is rewarded on a monthly basis.
- Minimum SLA = Service Level Agreement (see special section about SLA) needs to be achieved before CHI can be rewarded.
