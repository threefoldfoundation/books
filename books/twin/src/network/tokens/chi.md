## CHI is scarce

- 5.000 nodes results in 100-150.000.000 CHI over 5 years.
- 5.000 nodes enable +- 250.000 to 500.000 users with their digital life.
- Each user renting a twin needs about 50 CHI to do so, this results in the requirement of 300.000.000 CHI per year (if they would hold it per year).
- 1m users buying FFK's (the twins) at these conditions, results in +-1.000.000.000 CHI.
- Clearly there are not enough CHI's which means the CHI price needs to go up ad the network grows.
