<p><img src="mytwin/img/internet_sovereignity.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the current internet system I exist many times, each application provider owns my data and provides functionality they own and let me use in return for my data.</p>
<p>We are sovereign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am me, I am sovereign, I am capabable to make my own decisions.</li>
<li>I have an identity, I do exist, I want to be able to control my own destiny.</li>
<li>What I learn and experience is mine. </li>
<li>I do not exist for the benefit of others. </li>
<li>I have my own digital skills and capabilities, these are owned by me.</li>
<li>Everything I produce is owned by me, and stored by my twin on locations me and my twin know about.</li>
<li>Because the capabilities are owned by me then can easily be extended and I can use them everythere, it makes my life easier, I don't have to learn different tools each time I enter another event.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-compare-this-to-real-life"><a class="header" href="#lets-compare-this-to-real-life">Lets compare this to real life.</a></h2>
<p>To make this more tangible, lets compare a digital experience with a real life one like going to an educational event.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-2-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-2-way">The Web 2 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to a educational event. Its very affordable, maybe even free.</li>
<li>They ask me to change clothes and use theirs, so we all look alike.</li>
<li>I am not allowed to bring or use my own tools. They give me theirs like a pen, headset, glasses, a notebook all of this I am asked to return at the end.</li>
<li>The event creators keep my freedom limited and overwhelm me with audio/video experience, if I am allowed to chose its all based on their scripts</li>
<li>They drive me around from activity to activity in the experience, its all very well done and impressive.</li>
<li>They track everything I do, to make sure they can adjust the experience to have me even more impressed next time, because they want me to come back.</li>
<li>If I take notes its on their notebook, but I can't take it with me, if they destroy it its gone.</li>
<li>I am happy, because its all incredible and very well done</li>
<li>I take the commercial content for granted because yeh, you know I got this for a low cost, they need to make money too.</li>
<li>If I want to get back to the content of the event, I need to pay again and go through the event again.</li>
<li>If I would go to another (similar) event from another provider, I would have to restart from scratch, I get other tools, another notebook, I cannot reuse what I have produced on the first event.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the good thing is, I don't have to think that much and its very addictive, they learn very well what we like and keep on improving constantly, so we wanna come back. </p>
<h3 id="the-web-3-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-3-way">The Web 3 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All as above, but the event is not owned by 1 company but by all of us.</li>
<li>We have a vote in how the event should be created</li>
<li>Its at least better because if working properly its a consensus owned experience.</li>
<li>Now at least we have the feeling we co-own how the event is being created.</li>
<li>We will realize its all very hard to run a real democracy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-web-4-or-web-remade-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-4-or-web-remade-way">The Web 4 or Web Remade way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to the education event.</li>
<li>They check if the tools I have are up to date for the experience they have created. If not they tell me where I can get new tools (upgrade them), but they remain mine. These tools are my core digital capabilities or skills.</li>
<li>I can now go into the event and experience the experience as prepared for me, I walk freely around, I take notes on my notebook, so I can use it later.</li>
<li>I have a lot of freedom where to go, in which order to experience.</li>
<li>I can use many more of my capabilities, and I don't have to learn new ways how to do something, because the tools (capabilities) are mine. I can dance, sing, run, jump, ...</li>
<li>I will be able to do things the creators of the event did not foresee, there is so much joy and freedom, I am creative, I am alife.</li>
<li>Its easier to make friends, because I can bring my friends in much more easy ways, because they already have the required capabilities.</li>
<li>I can give authenticity to the experience, my feedback matters from out of my own power.</li>
<li>It might be I have to think and act more myself, I am using my tools (capabilities) in the incredible experience as created by the education event organizers.</li>
<li>I will be super happy because I feel empowered, I am less addicted maybe because less controlled, but I know whatever I learned is for me to keep, I felt productive because I was allowed to use my capabilities and my data was enriched.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: This event can be single owned or co-owned (like in web3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't this sound like a better idea, don't we wanna have a tool which works that way?</p>

<p>We all exist many times, for each application we exist, it actually is very messy and leads to manipulation and also complexity. Its not convenient having to use 3 different messaging apps.

<p>each FFK gives you the right to give away 3 other FFK’s to people who cannot afford to buy or rent an FFK, or to your friends. A free FFK is the same as a normal FFK but has less storage &amp; compute capacity, and certain features may not be available on a free FFK. </p>

<h2 id="ffks-are-scarce"><a class="header" href="#ffks-are-scarce">FFK's are scarce</a></h2>
<p>At start there are only 1.000.000 FFKs available. The DAO will have to approve more of them later and the price is expected to be different. </p>
<p>From every initial FFK sold 40% goes to ThreeFold (technology provider) and 60% goes to FreeFlow Treasury. Do note there is only a certain amount of storage &amp; compute capacity included, if users go over it they will need more CHI (The FreeFlow Internet Token).
For people who don’t want to buy a FFK they can also rent one that will be at a rate of 5 USD per month to start with, the owner of the FFK gets this rent, this will be arranged from the DAO.</p>
<p>The DAO will use the treasury to fund development work for the FreeFlow Project as well as help projects to build value on top (experience) by means of grants.</p>
<p>(*) FreeFlow DAO is the ultimate governance mechanism of the FreeFlow DAO and as such might always change certain of the above described mechanisms.</p>

<li>CHI will now be in your wallet.</li>

<h2 id="remarks"><a class="header" href="#remarks">Remarks</a></h2>
<p>(*) CHI can also be bought with TFT, TFT is the token as created by farming on the ThreeFold grid, ThreeFold grid is the underlying network we use for FreeFlow, a Threefold farmer can exchange to CHI at the rate of the day (now 2 TFT for 1 CHI). This means every CHI is the result of farming !!!</p>
<p>(**) When you buy using USDC, the treasury will use this USDC to buy TFT and then switch to CHI. There are no CHI minted !!! The price of TFT and CHI will change over time.</p>
<p>(***) The exhange rate between CHI and TFT is defined regulary by the DAO to be market conform. We start with 1 CHI = 2 TFT.</p>

<p>We all have great things that we don’t use anymore that are stuck at our home. We won’t actually sell them and therefore no one benefits from it.
When markets fail due to limited supply of money or due to inefficient distribution, the traditional economical engine doesn’t function.</p>

<p>Lacking the tools to enable effective and sustainable
collaboration and sharing between children, teachers and the school.</p>
<p>Traditional marketplaces use money to measure the exchange of values and resources. However, money cannot be used as recognition for the children’s contributions in the school.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying our gratitude points as recognition for their contributions and positive exchanges enabled a remarkable impact and flow of values.
Children, teachers and parents support each other, their school and staff resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from passive listeners to mutual learning through peer-to-peer teaching.</li>
<li>Kids extend their real life capabilities by practicing new skills</li>
<li>Kids are significantly more engaged and happy</li>
<li>Increased capacity of the school to effectively handle it objectives</li>

<h2 id="usecase-3--social-delivery"><a class="header" href="#usecase-3--social-delivery">Usecase 3:  Social Delivery</a></h2>
<p><strong>Enterprises to NGOs</strong></p>
<p>Large businesses are storing unimaginable excess inventory of goods.</p>
<p>Goods that were returned by customers, didn’t sell during the season or simply finished their use even though they are still in great condition.</p>
<p>Those resources are stuck, expensive to store or dump and no one benefits from it.</p>
<p>Flow of enterprises’ excess capacity becomes an income for NGOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the valuable goods (in-kind donations).</li>
<li>Upload the goods to the Social Delivery (“SD”) marketplace.</li>
<li>Distribute points to the approved NGOs as a monthly budget.</li>
<li>NGOs shop in the SD marketplace for things they really need at the time needed. NGOs 1. exchange their points for chosen merchandises and equipment.</li>
<li>NGOs distribute these items to those communities they support.</li>
<li>NGOs saves significant amount of money.</li>
<li>Saved money enables the NGOs to better deliver on their core mission.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tax credits for “in-kind donations” motivate enterprises to further participate and benefit for doing good out of zero value inventory that cost them money to store or eliminate.</em></p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying Floweavers resulted in a win-win-situation both for the enterprises and the NGOs. The capacities and inventories that were stuck at the enterprises were donated and uploaded to the market place and became very useful for the NGOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating NGOs received a monthly budget of $2,156 - $10,385 in points</li>
<li>With this budget of points the NGOs could order online items that they needed</li>
<li>NGOs were enabled to also offer help (and not just get donations)</li>
<li>Keep their fiat money to better fulfill their core mission</li>
<li>Businesses linked their in-kind donations towards their corporate responsibility.</li>

<p>Use case of a Peer-to-Peer community shipping:</p>
<p>Betty needed to pick up an item from a member. On the way back home she delivered an item to another member who lives near her and gained additional points for it. The way it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betty is scheduled to meet Lee to pick up an item.</li>
<li>Lee asked Betty if she can also take another item for someone that lives next to her.</li>
<li>Betty agreed and picked up two items: one for herself, one for another member -Rachel</li>
<li>Rachel contacted Betty to schedule a pickup time to get the item.</li>
<li>Rachel rewarded betty with points for delivering the item closer to her home.</li>

<br>
<p><strong>The value of a digital life today per year is +10.000 USD (as estimated by some marketing companies) but in reality it's much higher, FreeFlow DAO is selling 1m FreeFlow Keys at 200 to 60 USD per FreeFlow key for a lifetime.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>By having an FreeFlow Key you get following direct benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>All skills and experiences as mentioned in this document.
<ul>
<li>Many more experiences being built, we will have everything required to allow you to have a safe &amp; private internet experience as complete as everything you have access to today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access to endless amounts of information free of charge (education, knowledge).</li>
<li>The ability to exchange anything for everything (money to money, money to service, money to goods, …) directly from supplier to buyer. This gives you at least 3x more buying power compared to today.</li>
<li>Ability to keep your data safe for ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of this is huge, there are 2 ways how to get to an FreeFlow Key</p>
<ul>
<li>You can rent a FreeFlow Key: 5 USD worth of CHI per month (not possible yet)</li>
<li>You can buy a FreeFlow Key: 200-60 USD worth of CHI, lifetime valid</li>

<h2 id="tokenomics"><a class="header" href="#tokenomics">Tokenomics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are only 1.000.000 FFK's in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>FFKs are the alternative to a license fee for having access to technology
<ul>
<li>40% of the sales goes to ThreeFold (see www.threefold.io) to keep on further creation of the tech.</li>
<li>60% goes to the FreeFlow Treasury of the FreeFlow DAO which will use to fund the growth of ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FFK's can only be bought by <a href="network/tokens/chi.html">CHI's</a>, see <a href="network/tokens/../buy/buy_my_twin.html">here</a></li>
<li>CHI's can only be farmed or bought with TFT (the utility token of ThreeFold).</li>
<li>FFKs can be rented from the Freeflow DAO or any FFK holder at a to be defined price (prob around 5 USD per month). </li>
<li>If there are not enough FFK available for rent, then the DAO can create FFK's for rental only purpose and owned by treasury.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Price of CHI at start is 0.1 USD. CHI is the utility token of freeflow and represents Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold grid. CHI is created by <a href="network/tokens/../farming/farming_intro.html">FreeFlow Farmers</a>. You can buy CHI from the Algorand Blockchain. Be aware that the price per FFK in CHI will be variable over time as CHI price changes in USD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each CHI links into the ThreeFold Token called TFT, at this stage the currency exchange rate is 0.5 CHI corresponds to 1 TFT. Every TFT holder can exchange their TFT for CHI at this rate, or the other way around. ThreeFold is the capacity layer on top of which FreeFlow has been built.</p>

<p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. </p>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, cabling or radio links, repeaters, modems etc. An Internet Protocol address (IP address), a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, enables us to the Internet Protocol for communication and store/run data on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, e-mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony (calls), file sharing, and streaming media services.</p>
<p>Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in centralized data centers owned by a few large corporations. This centralized model is inefficient, as through it's centralized model, if the main servers go down, the whole system experiences downtime. Hundreds of downtime events have been recorded throughout the last few years. Also, given these companies own the data centers, they also own the data that is contained in them and use it for profit reasons. </p>

<p>More than 500 undersea cables and thousands more terrestrial networks connect us all together digitally. These cables carry our data between server and recipient. While satellites also play a role in connectivity, without cables it's safe to say the global Internet would not be what it is today.</p>

<h1 id="the-internet-data-centers"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-data-centers">The Internet Data Centers</a></h1>
<p>Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:</p>
<h2 id="centralization"><a class="header" href="#centralization">Centralization</a></h2>
<p>The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h2>
<p>It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model</p>
<h2 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage and consume around 205 TWh - More than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>The current IT stack depends on human error and it has been considered as the major cause of cybersecurity breaches with more than 95% of the cases. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information</p>
<h2 id="cannot-support-future-demand"><a class="header" href="#cannot-support-future-demand">Cannot Support Future Demand</a></h2>
<p>To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will be needed to build and consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.</p>

<p><img src="theinternet/img/internet_bandwidth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet today is constructed in a centralized way. The hyperscale data centers that form the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure play a massive role in our digital lives, and they are often located far from users, particularly those living in developing countries or regions. Each time we take an online action such as posting a photo or sending a message, the data is transmitted from our device to that centralized data center, and to the person or persons on the other end. So, you can begin to see how proximity to these servers plays a role in the end user experience.</p>
<p>Internet bandwidth refers to the amount of information or data that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for speed, but they are not the same. Whereas bandwidth is how much information you receive in a given time, speed is how fast that information is received.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of filling a swimming pool with water. If the hose has a wide circumference, more water can flow than if the hose were narrow. In this instance, water is the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows is the speed.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into both bandwidth and speed. An end-to-end network path usually consists of multiple connections, each with different bandwidth capacity. And the link with the lowest bandwidth can limit the overall capacity of all connections in the path. When data travels shorter distances, this is less of a factor. Network congestion (usage) is also a major factor. And it's pretty clear to see how by traveling long distances, this would become a bigger problem.</p>
