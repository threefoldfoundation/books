<p>Affordable, performant and accessible internet for everyone, empowering the people of Tanzania and Zanzibar</p>
<p>If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us anything, it is that digital is a necessity. It guarantees the continuity of services in the event of a crisis, and is also essential for ensuring a country’s competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>To initiate Tanzania’s digital transformation and ensure the social, financial and digital inclusion of all its citizens, the country needs to embark on a digitisation strategy focused on:</p>
<p><strong>Digital sovereignty and Unlocking of the Internet Economy</strong>
Today, Tanzanias digitial economy wholly relies on US, Asia and European technologies, deployed and operated in these remote areas. This is a GDP drain for Tanzania as a country, it is GDP negative.  To make Tanzanias economy GPD positive it has to start deploying, operating and creating local technology and use it to increase sovereignty of the country instead of digital dependency on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>A sustainable digital transformation can only be achieved if it is founded on digital sovereignty, which is the primary reason for the PPP between the Tanzanian public sector, private sector and Threefold to unlock the Tanzanian internet eocnomy.</p>
<p>Key to this strategy is establishing a sovereign internet infrastructure that ensures Tanzania's digital sovereignty and, more generally, the successful digitalisation of the economy and unlocking of the internet economy.</p>
<p>Three initiatives will spearhead the realization of Tanzania Digital Sovereignty and the unlocking of its Internet Economy. </p>
<p><strong>1. Digitisation of Key Economic Sectors:</strong> Increasing national wealth through the building of an innovation and start-up ecosystem looks at digitalising key sectors of Togo’s economy (logistics, trade, agriculture, etc.), creating support programs for start-ups and using big data to help public and private sector decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Digitisation of Civil Services:</strong> The objectives pursued here aim to offer citizens better access to public services and to speed up administrative procedures Focused on , on the administrative gains made possible by digital technology, It covers the digitisation of administrative procedures and basic social services, the paperless management of financial flows (tokenization of civil services) and the training of the various segments of society in the use of technological tools. </p>
<p><strong>3. Universal Access to Information:</strong> Knowledge is power and ensuring every Tanzanian citizen has affordable access to the wealth of information made possible by the www is key in the empowerment of the Tanzanian population. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="description-of-the-project"><a class="header" href="#description-of-the-project">Description of the Project</a></h2>
<p>The Tanzania Sovereign Internet Platform (“TSIP”) as envisaged in the memorandum of understanding (see appendix A), is a end to end ecosystem blending people, technology and key principles in order to deliver Internet Infrastructure and digital services that ensure the privacy, sovereignty and empowerment of Tanzania and its people. </p>
<p>The purpose of the TSIP ecosystem is to UNLOCK THE INTERNET ECONOMY in Tanzania and empower ECONOMIC DEVLOPEMENT and SOCIAL UPLIFTMENT of its people.</p>
<p>The make up of such an ecosystem includes:</p>
<p><img src="intro/./../img/ecosystem.png" alt="ecosystem" /></p>
<h3 id="soveriegn-internet-grid-powered-by-threefold"><a class="header" href="#soveriegn-internet-grid-powered-by-threefold">Soveriegn Internet Grid (powered by Threefold)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>a network of decentralised, autonomous and distributed edge micro data centre infrastructure forming a meshed internet grid.</li>
<li>located entirely within Tanzania, providing national sovereignty over data and all associated revenue streams as well as security and immunity from disruption</li>
<li>the foundational layer of the TSIP ecosystem, powered by Threefold technology, providing the compute, storage and network resources, enabling FreeFlow Life and further digital services to empower the nation of Tanzania</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="digital-experiences"><a class="header" href="#digital-experiences">Digital Experiences</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>the layer of digital services running of top of the grid infrastructure that give purpose to the soverign internet grid and bring true value to the people of tanznaia</li>
<li>example: FREEFLOW LIFE
<ul>
<li>a prime example of such a digital service is FREEFLOW LIFE, the primary internet experience of TSIP giving every TZN citizen their digital life in one experience. </li>
<li>a universally accessible digital platform through which Tanzanians can access improved alternatives to commonly used global communications, media and productivity software;</li>
<li>Freeflow Life ensures every citizen is guaranteed their privacy, sovereignty and all the digital services they need to not only exist, but to thrive in the TZN digital economy </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>other key digital experiences intended for TSIP include:
<ul>
<li>VIRTUAL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY </li>
<li>REMOTE EDUCATION </li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incubation-hub-mama-samia-institute"><a class="header" href="#incubation-hub-mama-samia-institute">Incubation Hub (Mama Samia Institute)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>An incubation hub to empower the development of further digital services to run on top of the TSIP platform and further empower and uplift the community of Tanzania.  Such examples include:
<ul>
<li>Virtual healthcare delivery</li>
<li>Online education curriculum</li>
<li>Agriculture improvements through data ownership</li>
<li>Digital banking</li>

<h3 id="current-economic-landscape"><a class="header" href="#current-economic-landscape">Current Economic Landscape</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Economy of Tanzania in 2021  With an average real GDP growth rate of 6.3% over the past decade (2010-2019), </li>
<li>Tanzania is among the fastest-growing economies in Africa and in the world. </li>
<li>Yet, widespread poverty persists with 49 percent of Tanzania’s population living below the international extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day (World Bank, 2011)</li>
<li>In 2020, the real GDP of Tanzania grew by +4.8% reaching USD 64.4 billion, and grew by +7% in 2019  to reach USD 60.8 billion In April 2021, </li>
<li>Tanzania’s new president Samia Suluhu Hassan gave her first speech to the parliament, mentioning the priorities of the Sixth Phase Government in the next five years to reach a GDP growth rate of at least 8% yearly. </li>
<li>Notable sectors of the Tanzanian economy are tourism, mining, construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. Tanzania Key Economic Sectors According to the economic data included in the National Data of Tanzania Mainland of 2013-2019 by the National Bureau of Statistics, at current market prices, 
<ul>
<li>Services made the highest shares of GDP (40.0%) </li>
<li>followed by Industry and Construction (31.1%) </li>
<li>Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing  (28.9%) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="market/./../img/tanzania_gdp.png" alt="Tanzania GDP" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Among Tanzania’s predominantly rural population (73 percent), economic growth has been limited. Inclusive, broad-based growth is hindered by low productivity growth in labour-intensive sectors like agriculture, which employs 77 percent of working age adults. The agriculture sector grew just 4 percent per year over the past decade.</p>
<p>The Tanzanian private sector’s vast financial resources and expertise in market-based solutions have the potential for tackling systemic societal challenges. Currently employing about 70 percent of the youth in Tanzania, the private sector provides a critical pathway to self-reliance.</p>
<p>USAID objectives include advancing Tanzania’s socio-economic status toward middle-income status by 2025; sustaining inclusive, broad-based economic growth; supporting private sector investment in energy as well as agriculture and natural resource-based tourism; and increasing the access of women and youth to resources and knowledge that allow them to take advantage of opportunities in these sectors.</p>

<p>TSIP must enable the social upliftment of Tanzanian people and afford every citizen universal and impartial access to the necessary civil services to ensure their individual success and well being, Critical success factors in delivering on the above are the fundamental attributes of TSIP, including:</p>
<p><strong>Sovereign Digital Identity</strong> </p>
<p>In the digital era, the starting point to our success as digital citizens is ensuring our digital sovereignty identity. Freeflow life is our digital twin in the internet economy and is a verified and immutable representation of us as a digital citizen.</p>
<p>Looking at all of us as an internet and a country citizens our identities are not linked between the physical and the digital world.  Almost every country, region, city or social community has their own requirements and way of handling identity.  This is replicated in the digital world a 100 times over where every online company, service or platform has their own digital identity requirements.</p>
<p>This complete fragmentation of identities leads to a lot of complexity for people (citizens) to manage their identity. Most people manage this complexity by using the same username and password everywhere.  This lowers the security of these identities and causes a lot of breaches because once one service or platform is hacked this potentialy  exposes the username and password for many other platforms as well.</p>
<p>One, souvereign, technically well designed and built digitial identity solves all of these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Data Sovereignty &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>For Tanzanian people most (if not all) of the internet services that are available are invented and operated by foreign companies using private technology.  The result of this a working service, but also that all (meta) data created and stored is governed by foreign laws.</p>
<p>Citizens, companies and the government of Tanzania have little to no control over what happens with the data processes and stored in these online services. The use of foreign services results in a net negative contribution to the Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>To achieve data sovereignty and privacy the data and processing of it needs to be done on Tanzanian soil, governed by Tanzanian law and create plus operated by Tanzanian inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Digital disruption may be an accomplished fact for consumers enjoying ever more innovation, and for the firms driving it, but there is little evidence of macroeconomic disruption. Despite the relentless transformation of the user experience, the idea of meaningfully higher productivity growth across the economy remains wishful thinking. Especially for Tanzania where most of the digitial disruption has happened by large foreign companies who have extracted a lot of value from the Tanzanian economy.</p>
<p>To make the maximum productivity impact first the value extraction from tha Tanzanian economy to the digital giants has to decrease and if possible stopped. For this to happen Tanzania needs to invest and create sovereign solutions to these global giants.  This is the first step to start building local momentum to help to increase the productivity in the broadest sense to help the Tanzanian economy to get a boost from digitial services and enablement.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Digital Access</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Affording every citizen universal access to valuable content, networks and resources to promote the health, education and welfare of the people of Tanzania, including:
<ul>
<li>Universal access to education</li>
<li>Universal access to financial services</li>
<li>Universal access to healthcare services</li>
<li>Universal access to information in general</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Healthcare is a fundamental right for every single member of society and the Tanzaznian goverment carries the responsibility for healthcare delivery as a primary civil service. </p>
<p>The challenge in most emerging markets is the lack of healthcare professionals and infrastructure relative to the needs of the community and the size of the population itself. This imbalance poses significant challenges for goverment who simply do not have enough budget, skilled professionals nor infrastructure to meet the needs of its citizens in this regard.</p>
<p>Based on our research, the situation on the ground in Tanzania mirrors this exact dilemma whereby the shortage of budget, infrastructure and healthcare professionals relative to the needs of the cmmunity results in sub par service delivery on behalf of the government. </p>

<p>The simple answer to scaling healthcare delivery given these constraints is:</p>
<h3 id="1-datafication"><a class="header" href="#1-datafication">1. DATAFICATION</a></h3>
<h3 id="2-virtualisation"><a class="header" href="#2-virtualisation">2. VIRTUALISATION</a></h3>
<h3 id="3-tokenisation"><a class="header" href="#3-tokenisation">3. TOKENISATION</a></h3>
<p>explained as follows...</p>
<h2 id="1-datafication-1"><a class="header" href="#1-datafication-1">1. Datafication</a></h2>
<p>By definition,  is a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into datail which is subsequently transferred into information realised as a new form of value</p>
<p>In simple terms, this is the collection of healthcare data and aggregation of medical records to establish a full patient medical history (medical 360), gain key insights and idenitfy macro health trends and unlock the value of real time data for the benefit of every citizen/ patient.</p>
<p>This process involves both historical data aggregation and real time data collection:</p>
<h3 id="historical-data"><a class="header" href="#historical-data">Historical Data</a></h3>
<p>Based on a an EMR (electronic medical record) is the aggregation of all historical data from all possible legacy data sources to establish a single and full perspective on a patient history. This single healthcare record per citizen is:</p>
<ul>
<li>guaranteed private and always in the control of the citizen who owns that data</li>
<li>stored in quantum safe storage on the TSIP network</li>
<li>secured and ensured immutable by the TSIP blockchain </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="real-time-data"><a class="header" href="#real-time-data">Real Time Data</a></h3>
<p>Based on being able to collect and diagnose real time information from patients via a cirtual healthcare platform, enabling healthecare professionals more insights and data points on which they can make a diagnosis and recommend an appropriate treatment protocol. In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>data collection is deviceless meaning the patient needs nothing more than a smartphone to provide this information realtime, in virtual consultation</li>
<li>data is measured by the smartphone camera and uploaded to the patient EMR record for diagnosis by the healthcare professional</li>
<li>data is collecte dreal time but is stored and associated to an active consultation which can be queued awaiuting the availability of a healtcare professional who can in due course, use the data to formulate a diagnosis and recommedn a treatment proitocol. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-virtualisation"><a class="header" href="#1-virtualisation">1. VIrtualisation:</a></h2>
<p>In computing terms, virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level.</p>
<p>In simple terms, to virtualise healthcare delivery means to digitalise the whole patient experience so far as possible. In essence, make the end to end healthcare process an online experience and minimise the need for a patient to visit a healthcare facility and see a healthcare professionals in person.</p>
<p>In practice, this is essentially telemedicine, but in this case, with some fundamental diofferences vs  what the industry today recognises. Telemendicine has advanced our ability to deliver healthcare signifucantly by virtuakisibg the atient epxerince and essentially bringing healthcare professionals to the patient via an application. Hoiwever, whist this has realised signifuicant efficiency in healthcare service delivery, there are stiull obvious limitations in telemedicine as it is today with regards to the scope of practice that can be delivered via a virtual service.</p>
<p>The limitations referred to above is that only minor conditions can be consulted and diagnosed via a virtual platform given the lack of data available between the patienta nd the healthcare proifessional. This lack of hiostiorical and more importantly, real time data is a major limiting factor in the types of cases that can be dealt with in an online virtual experience</p>
<p>More on this key constraint and this can be overcome in the s ection below: ###</p>
<h2 id="tokenisation"><a class="header" href="#tokenisation">Tokenisation:</a></h2>
<p>In technical terms, Tokenisation is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets.</p>
<p>In simple terms, a token is a digital representation of something that has inherent value. This can be financial, asset based or other.</p>
<p>Relative to this context, tokenisation means the digitisation of the health budget to allow for simple and fair distribution of value. </p>
<p>In this case, we refer to a ditial token, backed and representing the national health budget, remittable for the redemption of healthcare services on behalf of the government by the citizens of Tazania.</p>
<p>In practice, the process can be as simple as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the national healthcare budget is tokenised and minted on the blockchain in a fully automated process</li>
<li>these digital tokens, representing healthcare services by the government, are distributed electronically to the digital wallet of each citizen (typically the digital wallet is on their cellular phone) on a equitable basis.</li>
<li>citizens then have the means to redeem virtual healthcare services redeemed using the inherent value ion the digital tokens they were issued.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process of tokenisation ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li>equitable distribution of value between all citizens</li>
<li>concise and immutable management of budget and resources</li>
<li>key insights and data trends such as:
<ul>
<li>how healthcare infrastructure and resources are utilised</li>
<li>spend per citizen on healthcare</li>
<li>annual cycles in health related problems</li>
<li>geographical data insights realtive to spending and health trends</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution-overview"><a class="header" href="#solution-overview">Solution Overview</a></h2>
<p>A truly virtualised healthcare solution, including tokenisation and datafication (as above) is underpinned by the decentralised, autonomous infrastructure of TSIP.</p>
<p>TSIP delivers on the fundamental requirements to ensure the Virtual Healthcare solution lives up to its promise of:</p>
<ul>
<li>privacy</li>
<li>soverigenty</li>
<li>security (quantum safe)</li>
<li>immutability</li>
<li>scalability</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Architecturally, the virtual healthcare solution is depicted as follows:</p>
<p>Layer 0: TSIP Network
Layer 1: Threefold Blockchain
Layer 2: Experiences layer where virtual healthcare platform is deployed</p>
<h2 id="key-desigbn-principles"><a class="header" href="#key-desigbn-principles">Key desigbn principles:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Patient Centric: conversely to the industry norm, VHP is designed around the patient, putting the patient first. Historically, the patient would always go tot he practitioner, at the halethcare facility. Medi.me is 100% patient centric and birng all practitioners, insurers, service providers to the patient</li>
<li>Verifiable Identification: all actors within the ecosystem are verified by a soveriegn identity. No BAD Actors</li>
<li>Immutable Records:</li>
<li>Tokenised Assets</li>

<p><img src="capabilities/./../img/oc.png" alt="communication tool chat" /></p>
</div>
<h2 id="communication-tool-chat"><a class="header" href="#communication-tool-chat">Communication tool: Chat</a></h2>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage individual and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging service always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA;
    subgraph Messaging provider;
    MESSAGINGA(messaging platform);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform.  This also means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data.</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging sends and receives messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance.  It does not have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot; and all the other members are invites to post and receives message from this group.  The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between to entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ).  In this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle.  Only the (twins of) two people involved has access tot he message data (and metadata)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| TWINA
    TWINA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA
    end
    TWINA(Twin A - Chat Functionality) .-&gt;|secure network| TWINB(Twin B - Chat Functionality)
    subgraph Individual B
    TWINB .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|Browser| TWINB
    TWINB --&gt;|secure network| TWINA
    end
</pre>
<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionality know from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.
<img src="capabilities/../capabilities/../img/chat_overview.png" alt="private_chat" /></p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer to peer chat platform.  The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators messaging platform (twin).  The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get read and write access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<p>A truly peer to peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers.  Take for example to users in Zanzibar that wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same).  The will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>

</div>
<p>This does not lead to create the best experience and over all, it is very wasteful with a number of (scarce) resources.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to have a video conference solution that works peer to peer.</p>

<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils.  This method has been in use for hundreds of years.  In this digital age there the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching and all of the rest of the required items can be digitised as well.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however is has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils.  In this digital world we can record end present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience that a single classroom.  Classes, or better while curriculum can be digitised and share along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this.  This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching.  Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform as a platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school.  This allows this education solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<p>Although functionally this setup provides good co-working capabilities we see that both co-workers are using a central facility and the data is stored in that serivce provides datacenter.  This is how most online services work and most online service provider exist in the US, Europe and Asia.  This present challenges with regards to data ownership, sovereignty and all sort of other legal challenges.</p>
<p>Office tools can be deployed locally if and when there is a digital infrastucture that can process and store data.  The Twin technology allows the office tools to be run in country, owned by the individual or company and therefore all the names challenges and legal complexity fade.</p>
<p>The principle of doing it that way would look as follows:</p>

<p>This way, person A is providing the Office tool from his twin and invites other people to cooperate in this office tool. The Twin can run anywhere (as determined by the operator, person A).  With this priciple we can create individuals or companies that operate and own their own office tool and datastorage platform.</p>

<p>The feasibility study is architected around the Tanzanian countries demographics and technical infrastructure availability.  For a  decentralized internet priority number one is to model it around communities and size around community / population density. The driver is to have digital assets located as close as possible to the actual owner of the digital asset (data).  Demographic data drives the initial layout of the local internet structure.</p>
<p>The second driver is utility availability. The country utilities which are major drivers for this are power and network (internet) connectivity.  Power and internet access availability is considered in two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing real estate with reliable power and network connectivity</li>
<li>existing real estate without reliable power and network connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially we are going to focus on real estate that has existing reliable power and network available. The process to determine what areas are in scope for the feasibility study to prove that the internet infrastructure is able to power enablement use cases will follow these technical requirements, in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>population density</li>
<li>power and  network availability and reliability</li>
<li>access to real estate</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h4 id="population-density"><a class="header" href="#population-density">Population density</a></h4>
<p>Decentralised internet deployments follow population distribution. Denser areas require more local capacity (more and larger deployments) while less densely populated areas can have sparser (and smaller deployments).  For the technical design of capacity instances and sizing  population demographics are key drivers.</p>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Densely populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
<li>Medium populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
<li>Sparsely populated (numbers to be defined)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_pop_original.png" alt="population original" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>This is a dated population density overview which provides a first insight into the population spread in Tanzania.  From the density map we can extract a key focus are map which looks liek this:</p>
<p><img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_pop_meta.png" alt="population meta" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>These highlighted areas are the areas that are of interest because they will have more likely than not all the required infrastructure and utility available to do a simple rollout of digital enabling infrastructure layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h4 id="power-availability-and-reliability"><a class="header" href="#power-availability-and-reliability">Power availability and reliability</a></h4>
<p>Power availability is a key technical driver for capacity deployments.  Power availability, quality and reliability are significant drivers for deployments</p>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power type 1: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power + backup facility</li>
<li>Power type 2: Grid power, 24*7 available grid power - no backup facility</li>
<li>Power type 3: Grid power, sporadically available </li>
<li>Power type 4: No grid power (solar, battery, generator).</li>
</ol>
<p>The national grid (needs more research) is looking as follows:</p>
<p><img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_power_original.png" alt="power original" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<!-->
<img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_power_original.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
-->
<p>We are getting more detailed and recent information on the power grid in Tanzania but this represents a first good start.  Everything that is considers close to the major power distribution lines is meant to be stable and reliable.  The further aways from these major power distribution lines, available power becomes scarcer and less reliable.</p>
<p><img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_power_meta.png" alt="power meta" /></p>
<p>Extracting the areas where major powerlines bring sufficient quantity and quality power to operate installations.  These areas are the preferred areas to build a proof of concept in.</p>

<p>Combining the power infrastructure and densely populated ares delivers the following primary areas of interest to consider for deploying decentralized internet capacity.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Population density</th><th>Power grid availability</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>Making these two source of areas of interest overlap we can clearly identify what the areas of interest are combined
<img src="technology/./../img/tanzania_conbined_meta.png" alt="combined_meta" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>The combination of this information leads to a phased approach for the feasibility study.  These phases look as follows:</p>

<p>Combined:</p>

<p>A decentralized internet depends on capacity deployments in existing real estate. It uses data centers and telco space for some more densely populated areas but for the other (edge) deployments it requires existing real estate.  Also here deployments follow availability of reliable real estate.  To find appropriate locations of capacity deployments we should identify where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realestate have utility rooms facilitation power and other utility in the building</li>
<li>Reliable power and power backup (if available)</li>
<li>Reliable network and network backup (if available)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these criteria we can define technical feasibility for internet capacity deployments based on real estate characteristics availability.</p>
<p>Categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Telco grade datacenter or POP (including mobile mast).</li>
<li>Concrete and brick commercial, tower or office building (government, university, school or company owned)</li>

<p>Depending on the demograpics requirements identifies in the previous paragraph we can now defined a number of deployments types that create internet capacity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deployment 1: Telco. Rack of equipment that provides
<ol>
<li>compute, storage and (local) networking. </li>
<li>no backup power infrastructure required</li>
