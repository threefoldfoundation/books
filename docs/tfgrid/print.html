<p><strong>&quot;When you were born in a world where you don’t fit in, you were born to help create a new one.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Internet of Internets is owned by the people.</li>
<li>It interconnects us all, directly, without anyone in the middle.</li>
<li>We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.</li>
<li>On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.</li>
<li>Not to control. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.</li>
<li>Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.</li>
<li>A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.</li>
<li>As believers in a better world who choose to act.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>&quot;The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world.&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>We can continue down the path we’re on.<br />
But ask yourself, is it a good one? Is it the right one? Is it just?<br />
Is the world we live in today the one we wish for our children and all those to come?</p>
<p>If yes, please continue.<br />
If not, we have an answer.</p>
<p>Come on, come all. Creators. Builders. Dreamers. No need to dream anymore.</p>
<p>This is the Internet of Internets.<br />
It’s for you. For me. For all of us.<br />
By you. By me. By all of us.</p>
<p>So, are you with us? Then come along.<br />
Together we build our own future through the Internet of Internets.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="long-story-short"><a class="header" href="#long-story-short">Long Story Short</a></h1>
<p><img src="tfgrid/intro/img/threefold_intro.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The truth is that ThreeFold is a big project. Here we will try to make things a little simpler for you.</p>
<h2 id="so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why"><a class="header" href="#so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why">So, ThreeFold is building a new Internet. Why?</a></h2>
<p>What it boils down to is that currently the Internet is only available to about 1/2 of the world (meaning billions are being left behind), it is centralized (a handful of large corporations profit off of our data), and it uses up to 10% of the world's energy consumption. So, we're building a new Internet that empowers equality (access), digital sovereignty (data ownership, for example), and sustainability (reduces energy consumption).</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h2>
<p>Everything on the Internet – websites, apps, photos, videos, etc – uses up capacity and is stored in huge data centers owned by big companies, mainly in North America, Europe, and some in Asia. In our solution, centralized data centers are replaced with a grid of &quot;nodes&quot; distributed around the world.</p>
<p>These nodes are owned by <a href="tfgrid/intro/farming_intro">ThreeFold Farmers</a> – but only the physical hardware – the data inside of the nodes belongs to the people or organizations who put it there. So, &quot;farmers&quot; plug in hardware and start to create capacity that can be used by people.</p>
<p>Farmers come in all shapes and sizes. Some farmers run small data centers while others simply run a node out of their living room.</p>
<p>When farmers connect active hardware (add capacity) to the ThreeFold_Grid, ThreeFold_Tokens are created. Farmers can then sell those tokens to people who want to use capacity (e.g. a developer that wants to build or host a website, or a person who wants to store some photos). More on tokens down below.</p>
<h2 id="seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it"><a class="header" href="#seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it">Seems quite lofty. How will you build it?</a></h2>
<p>It's true that rebuilding the Internet is not so simple. But a lot of infrastructure has already been built and the technology is quite advanced. Over the last 2+ years, independent <a href="tfgrid/intro/farming_intro">ThreeFold Farmers</a> have already plugged in more than 80,000,000 GigaBytes worth of storage and 14,000 CPU Cores across 20+ countries. That might not mean a lot to non-technical folks but it is quite a significant amount.</p>
<h2 id="20-countries-what-happened-to-equality"><a class="header" href="#20-countries-what-happened-to-equality">20+ countries? What happened to equality?</a></h2>
<p>As far along as we are, we still have work to do. One of our biggest goals in the near future is to expand the grid to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia where currently the Internet is too expensive or not available. Farming is incentivized around these key geographies.</p>
<h2 id="so-how-can-i-access--use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it"><a class="header" href="#so-how-can-i-access--use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it">So how can I access / use your Internet today? What can I do on it?</a></h2>
<p>For the everyday person looking to benefit from a new, neutral Internet, some of <a href="https://mydigitaltwin.io/info/twin#/">the first experiences are coming alive</a> Q1 2021. This includes communication tools, file storage, a wallet, &amp; more – all with the advantages of being more sustainable for our planet and with full control of your own data. And over time, more and more experiences will come to this Internet. We'll be updating here and on our communication platforms as they come. But don't worry, as a user it doesn't change much – no coding required. :)</p>
<p>That said, if you're an IT professional or a developer, you can take advantage of <a href="tfgrid/intro/cloud_home">the ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud</a>!</p>
<h2 id="will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet"><a class="header" href="#will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet">Will [enter website or app here] be available on your Internet?</a></h2>
<p>There are some tremendous reasons for a website or app to use our Internet, but that will really be up to the website or the app. In the end, we are providing a responsible solution for responsible people and organizations. We would love to host anybody who believes in what we are doing!</p>
<h2 id="how-are-you-making-sure-its-safe"><a class="header" href="#how-are-you-making-sure-its-safe">How are you making sure it's safe?</a></h2>
<p>Hacking has become a part of life and is almost impossible to avoid in the current systems – they are too complex and require too many people to operate. This results in less security which results in lots of security breaches. First of all, we are collectively building new infrastructure <a href="tfgrid/intro/grid_why">(The ThreeFold Grid)</a> which is totally peer-to-peer, meaning no third parties or intermediaries to store your data. Also, we took a look at the existing Internet and simplified it. By simplifying the architecture and instead creating technology that is self-driving &amp; self-healing, we removed the human requirement and therefore vastly minimized the possibility for hacking or human error. Then, we also developed a storage algorithm which makes it such that if some of the information gets lost or stolen (somehow) or if some hardware goes down, it is all retrievable. Long story short, we flipped the existing system on its head.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-data-ownership-part"><a class="header" href="#what-about-the-data-ownership-part">What about the data ownership part?</a></h2>
<p>That has a bit to do with the security as well. Since you own your data, you decide who gets access. Which means your data isn't just out &quot;there&quot; for the taking. Basically, we put <em>you</em> at the center of your digital life, where the applications and experiences you use serve you, not the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet"><a class="header" href="#and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet">And how is it better for the planet?</a></h2>
<p>There are a few reasons for us being more sustainable. Data centers are super unsustainable, so the simple (but incomplete) answer is &quot;no more huge data centers.&quot; But if you want more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use up to 3x less hardware for the same output, and using hardware at least 2x longer while maintaining good performance</li>
<li>Having capacity everywhere, local to where users are – this reduces network requirements (and can even improve security)</li>
<li>Using new algorithms (e.g. the one mentioned above for storage) which create a dramatic improvement in efficiency</li>
<li>Re-using hardware where possible – let’s not throw away</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-much-will-it-cost"><a class="header" href="#how-much-will-it-cost">How much will it cost?</a></h2>
<p>In the end we want to provide sustainable access to the Internet and all of its solutions for less than a dollar per month per person but for now the cost will depend on what you choose to do. Certain experiences will cost money. Storing photos or videos, for example. But all at a fair price.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-of-money--so-whats-up-with-the-threefold_token"><a class="header" href="#speaking-of-money--so-whats-up-with-the-threefold_token">Speaking of money – so what's up with the ThreeFold_Token?</a></h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, tokens are generated when ThreeFold Farmers adds capacity to the ThreeFold_Grid.</p>
<p>Essentially, the ThreeFold_Token is the medium of exchange on the new Internet. So, if a developer wants to build something (e.g. a website or an app) or a user wants to store something (e.g. photos), he/she/they use(s) ThreeFold_Tokens.</p>
<h2 id="need-more-answers"><a class="header" href="#need-more-answers">Need more answers?</a></h2>
<p>We hope that helps explain things. Obviously there is a whole wiki here to dive in to. If you don't find what you're looking for, please reach out us on <a href="https://forum.threefold.io">our forum</a>.</p>

<p><img src="tfgrid/intro/img/humanityplanet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="internet-access-is-a-human-right"><a class="header" href="#internet-access-is-a-human-right">Internet Access is a Human Right</a></h2>
<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf">the United Nations officially declared Internet access to be a human right</a>. The right to Internet access aims to protect people’s freedom of expression and opinion, as well as other fundamentals such as access to knowledge and information. </p>
<p>Yet as of 2019, <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates">about 43% of humanity remains unconnected to the Internet</a>, creating huge inequalities in the access to information and knowledge. It is important that the right steps are taken to improve the relationship between governments and citizens and to uphold all human rights.</p>
<p>To make the new Internet accessible and equal to all, ThreeFold built an infrastructure that is widely affordable and collectively-owned by the network peers. To ensure a fair and equal distribution of the Internet to everyone, the expansion and reach to regions that need Internet capacity the most will be incentivized and/or sponsored by the Foundation.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-should-be-autonomous"><a class="header" href="#everyone-should-be-autonomous">Everyone Should Be Autonomous</a></h2>
<p>The Internet evolved to become the world's largest database of information and knowledge, opening up exponential growth on personal, organizational and economic levels. Yet it is owned by large international companies that exploit users' data. </p>
<p>The current approach of many governments and countries is to cut the Internet into pieces by limiting its accessibility and enforcing regulations. We need an Internet that protects our digital freedom and provides fair access to global information for everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p>ThreeFold's Internet is a peer-to-peer Internet and owned by the users. All the technology of this new Internet is open-source and the whole experience is built around the fundamentals of a peer-to-peer network. On this new Internet, everyone owns their data and experiences - digital freedom.</p>
<h2 id="our-planet-needs-a-sustainable-internet"><a class="header" href="#our-planet-needs-a-sustainable-internet">Our Planet Needs a Sustainable Internet</a></h2>
<p>The current Internet <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255923829_Emerging_Trends_in_Electricity_Consumption_for_Consumer_ICT">consumes about 10% of global energy production</a>. With the imminent boom of emerging technologies such as Blockchain, Internet of Things, Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence, the Internet’s energy consumption is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2017-02-07-gartner-says-8-billion-connected-things-will-be-in-use-in-2017-up-31-percent-from-2016">expected to increase exponentially</a>. </p>
<p>The current industry's solutions focus on increasing the use of renewable energies to power data centers. However this is not a viable solution as data centers consume enormous amounts of energy. Therefore, a new solution that can drastically reduce the global Internet’s energy consumption is needed. </p>
<p>ThreeFold today brings the largest peer-to-peer Internet grid on the planet. It uses pioneering technologies that remove the need for centralized and power-hungry data centers, consumes up to 90% less energy, and uses up to 90% less international fiber network capacity.

<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>

<p>Create the infrastructure layer for an upgraded internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more reliable internet, one which can meet the challenges of the future 
(climate change issues, possibility of unrest, financial crisis, …). </li>
<li>A more sustainable internet, using a lot less energy</li>
<li>A more safe internet</li>
<li>An internet where we can be the center of our digital life with more security, less costs, no middleman, …</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing for</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiences which allow people to be free, safe and self sovereign.</li>
<li>Any application which puts the people in the center and allows them to have full control over their data &amp; future.</li>
<li>New financial systems (DEFI, but different than today's casino-like environment, peer2peer)</li>
<li>Projects which want to build communities to achieve planet positive goals.</li>
<li>Countries that choose to work in a decentralized manner</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course all of this can only happen by building communities and by collaborating with like minded projects/people.</p>
<h2 id="why-an-upgraded-internet"><a class="header" href="#why-an-upgraded-internet">Why an upgraded Internet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The current internet is very unstable (too centralized fiber cables, data centers, …)</li>
<li>The current internet is very unsafe</li>
<li>The current internet is not distributed enough, only in a few countries.</li>
<li>The current internet is too power hungry.</li>
<li>The current internet is too complicated</li>
<li>The current internet is exploitative, it turned us all into a product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars"><a class="header" href="#to-create-an-upgraded-abundance-based-system-we-need-to-provide-following-3-pillars">To create an upgraded abundance based system we need to provide following 3 pillars:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>a regenerative, safe, sovereign internet infrastructure layer = ThreeFold</li>
<li>an integrated stable decentralized financial system (DEFI) </li>
<li>a set of experiences (applications) and information to allow everyone on equal basis to learn, create, exchange, travel, … basically experience the abundance based world</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world where communities can build their own internet, from scratch, an internet which would deliver all the needs for a different future life. Each Internet deployed by the people for the people is called an OurWorld Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each Regional Internet abundance is the base:</p>
<ul>
<li>lots of free information, education, knowledge (books, encyclopedias), earth information (maps, videos), art (music, video, …), …</li>
<li>Your applications required for your digital professional and personal life are all free</li>
<li>You can find anything for free, you can promote everything for free.</li>
<li>You can freely exchange anything to anything else (money for good, good for good, money for money, …)</li>
</ul>
<p>This internet is “a peer2peer people’s internet”, created and owned by all of us together. The economic principles are dramatically different. Everything is available to build your own internet, from scratch. As a starting point you only need some computers and standard network equipment, all the rest is achieved by the magic of our threefold opensource software.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/waterfall.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets, is not one Internet as owned by the very few. It's thousands of interconnected Internets, where each Internet is founded and grown by a local community. YOU become The Internet.</p>
<p>OurWorld Internet of Internets is our chance to create a beautiful digital world in which we are free and powerful, a world where we can co-create a better future for everyone. We need to say NO to being a product of the large centralized corporations. We need to free ourselves, even from our own brainwashing.</p>
<p>We need a system where we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can be free and independent yet fully interconnected over all OurWorld Internet of Internets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn and play, grow in awareness and learn from each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t have to be afraid of an uncertain future where the privileged few define the next steps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t become addicted to the biggest potential drug called money (money is not bad, money can be beautiful, money should be an energy source for change)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drotect the beautiful planet we live on</p>

This zone will be a sandbox from which the OurWorld vision can be created and implemented in Zanzibar first with full support of the local government and community. As a side effect our community will demonstrate how a healthy and fun lifestyle can be the foundation for amazing passion, creativity and productivity. </p>

<p>Many countries don’t have an internet, they have a long cable to the Internet, this leads to loss in money, data, security, and human resources. It's our aim to support countries in building their Internet and provide economic chances to the ones who have a difficult time catching up in this hectic world.</p>
<p>Key Words:</p>

<p>Today most countries lose money because of the Internet, e.g. their citizens using services outside of their country, having to pay a lot for expensive Internet backbone (fiber) services, monetization of citizens data, …</p>
<p>Together with our friends we are talking to some countries who are very open about the possibilities of a sovereign country cloud.</p>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/globe.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>There are thousands of wonderful projects out there which want to provide value for the world but they miss a framework which helps them in achieving their goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>”The industry is talented in creating solutions to problems that should have never been there.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Much of the current Cloud &amp; Blockchain Industry is way too complicated and fragmented for what they need. </p>
<p>To build something today you need 10+ different systems and integrate them all. Many believe that an ecosystem of different solutions can be stitched together to create something bigger. History has already shown that this is not the case. We call this the ‘Onion Problem’ (more about this in a document I still have to write), but basically it means that systems get so complicated that people don’t dare to change anything inside so everyone keeps on creating other layers on top of the layers which already exist. This leads to even more complicated systems which no-one seems to fully understand and allowing hackers to have a great time because there are hundreds of places to find vulnerabilities in. Blockchain did not make things easier, it became even more difficult and non transparent.</p>
<p>It's difficult for projects to build a system which allows them to scale and work easily with their communities. The systems today are simply too complicated and unsafe (think about current wallets, exchanges, …)</p>
<p>The current way how the internet is created is just wrong, client - server is simply wrong, the fact that we exist 100 times on the internet is wrong, we need Web 4.0. We should not spend any time on anything which is not to the benefit of our Vision and The Planet</p>
<p>Benevolent projects need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A trust based system, where people can be themselves and communicate with each other and the project in a safe container with full identity and transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A financial (funding &amp; exchange) system which is safe, fast, reliable and easy to use for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An application and development platform which allows them to build their &quot;experience&quot; in the fastest possible way with less complexity and no need to re-invent everything (like is the case now).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A storage system where all data &amp; information is stored by the user and owned by the user. An ultra reliable system which can never lose data and which scales to a planetary scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy system so that less technical people can also use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which is cost effective, we know projects who went bankrupt by doing good because they could not afford existing centralized cloud systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system which keeps the data in the country where the people live, this leads to more performance and safety.</p>
</li>

<p><img src="mission/goals/img/threefold_infrastructure.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Every day farmers are adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, we are growing quite well organically. There is a booster to let this happen faster, that's by means of our neighborhood cloud initiative also called INCA.</p>
<p>A neighborhood cloud is like a community driven decentralized data center. The initiative provides residents, businesses, developers and the government in your city with a secure and highly available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally.  ThreeFold works with Real Estate developers to deploy a large amount of Internet capacity in their projects, which is a win-win situation for the developer, the home owner and ThreeFold.</p>
<p>A first project in Dubai for 170 Villa’s has been realized and there is now a funnel of at least 10 more. Each project brings Internet capacity to the local community which is the easiest way to expand the ThreeFold Grid.</p>
<p><img src="mission/goals/img/decentralized_dc.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Next to our Neighborhood Cloud expansion model, we support our global Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and commercial farmers. </p>
<p>A 2nd large neighborhood cloud is very close to being signed, this time with even more homes.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-cloud-units"><a class="header" href="#what-are-cloud-units">What are Cloud Units?</a></h2>
<p>Cloud units are the basis for price calculation for anyone intending to use/deploy on the Threefold Grid. </p>
<p>Cloud units are a unified way to account for virtual hardware resources on the ThreeFold Grid. They represent compute, storage and network equivalents to energy (kW - kilowatt). The are three categories of cloud units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute Unit (CU): The amount of data processing power in terms of virtual CPU (vCPU) cores (logical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPUs</a>) and Random Access Momory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a>).</li>
<li>Storage Unit (SU): The amount of storage capacity in terms of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs) in Gigabytes (GB).</li>
<li>Network Unit (NU): The amount of data that travels in and out of storage units or compute units expressed in GB.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <a href="tfgrid/cloudunits/resource_units.html">Resource units</a> are used to calculate SU &amp; CU. Resource Units are used to measure compute and storage capacity produced by hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a solution is deployed on the ThreeFold Grid, the system automatically gathers the required amount of CU, SU, or NU. It is important to note that users are not billed upon reservation but only when utilizing the actualy CU, SU and NU. TF Certified Farmers can define the price of CU, SU, and NU they make available on the ThreeFold Grid. </p>

<p>The passmark (CPU benchmark or alternative) is not measured on the grid yet. It is used in simulators to check the mechanisms and ensure enough performance per CU is delivered.</p>

<!-- ## Change Log

- original non final specs from Summer 2021, was mentioned its not final.
- Dec 2021 update for launch v3.x
  - there need to be at least 50 GB SSD capacity per CU
  - was in the specs of farming reward but formula above did not take it into consideration, in others nonconsistenty between specs & formula.
  - sru division to 200, was 300, to be more in line with HDD vs SSD pricing, this check needs to be done +- every 6 months, results in slightly more SU, which is good for farmers.
- Jan 2022 update for launch v3.x
  - reverted change done in Dec, sru does not have to be deducted from cpu, results in increase of farming rewards, in other words good for farmers. Also good formula more easy.
  - Introduced warning about minimum CPU requirements in relation to passmark.
