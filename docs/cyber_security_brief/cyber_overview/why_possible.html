<p>Backdoors are the reality of digital life, they might have been created with the  right intentions but the unintended consequences are dramatic.</p>
<p>Every motherboard, router, hard disk, CPU … purchased today has backdoors inside.</p>
<p>While this was intended to only be used by certain “instances” , this has grown completely out of hand.</p>
<p>The root keys and secrets are known by many and can be used and abused by whoever wants to do so including bad actors.</p>
<p>Hacking became a very big business, and the cyber attack pandemic became a reality. This topic should not be underestimated nor ignored, it's a sovereign issue, it's not too late now, but we need to act while there is still time.</p>

<h2 id="most-security-products-are-compromised"><a class="header" href="#most-security-products-are-compromised"><strong>Most security products are compromised</strong></a></h2>
<p>If you were a party looking for ways to access information, it might seem logical to insert “vulnerabilities” inside security products. It's a logical spot because these products are used to protect sensitive information, in other words allowing code and backdoors to be close to where the data and action is.</p>
<p>**DO NOT BELIEVE THAT GETTING SECURITY &amp; PROTECTION CAN BE OUTSOURCED !!! **</p>
<p><strong>SOVEREIGNTY CAN NOT BE OUTSOURCED</strong></p>
<h2 id="people-are-vulnerable"><a class="header" href="#people-are-vulnerable"><strong>People are vulnerable</strong></a></h2>
<p>We are certainly not implying that people are bad by design, but people are the vulnerable part of any IT system. Self-healing systems are the future, they allow systems to run, sometimes protected by consensus mechanisms like on blockchain to make sure that human “error” is less of an issue.</p>
<p>People related issues can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not enough education.</li>
<li>Genuine mistakes being  made (+90% of issues).</li>
<li>Bribery sometimes extortion of people who operate/deploy IT systems.</li>
<li>Manipulation by fear or media, resulting in wrong decisions.</li>
<li>Ego driven decisions, often IT people are by design unsecure, putting too much power in their hands is not always the wise decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simplicity, education, and transparency is the best solution here.</p>
<h2 id="centralization-is-a-root-cause-of-issues"><a class="header" href="#centralization-is-a-root-cause-of-issues"><strong>Centralization is a root cause of issues</strong></a></h2>
<p>The more centralization the more it's rewarding to hack. Spending millions to hack a system with millions of users is rewarding. Hacking a decentralized system where everyone needs to be dealt with individually is commercially far less rewarding .</p>
<p>Centralized systems are extremely vulnerable, the hacking surface is often massive. Social engineering, backdoors, javascript &amp; browser vulnerabilities, … lead to huge breaches when hacking happens.</p>
<h2 id="most-security-protocols-are-vulnerable"><a class="header" href="#most-security-protocols-are-vulnerable"><strong>Most security protocols are vulnerable</strong></a></h2>
<p>SSL is used everywhere to protect eCommerce and many more secured websites. SSL works based on a key exchange between client and server. Many routers on the internet are hacked (large majority) which leads to allowing “man in the middle attacks” to happen. It's a reality that most of the secure connections to centralized servers can be intercepted if there is any value to it.</p>
<p><br />
Many of these protocols lead to a false sense of security.</p>
<h2 id="hacking-is-a-commercial-business"><a class="header" href="#hacking-is-a-commercial-business"><strong>Hacking is a commercial business</strong></a></h2>
<p>I personally only have knowledge of the pricing of 3 years ago but at that time it would cost about 50k USD to get the digital life of a person, everything: email, chats, passwords, bank details…</p>
<p>A VIP was of course more expensive. There are massive hacking companies operating globally which pre-hack most of the devices on the internet.</p>
<p>This leads to security for the rich and leaves others unprotected and vulnerable leading to a vicious cycle where the unprotected are more abused and find themselves with fewer chances for creating prosperity for their nation.</p>
<h2 id="the-centralized-services-give-out-a-lot-of-information"><a class="header" href="#the-centralized-services-give-out-a-lot-of-information"><strong>The centralized services give out a lot of information</strong></a></h2>
<p>Services like Google, Facebook, … do have access to our full personal life. Where are we, what do we buy, how do we travel, who do we meet, what do we search for, it's now proven that our personal and business information are being compromised and used during our illusion of security and privacy. Many claim that this information is being used outside of the scope of the privacy regulations or even the expectations of the users. The real value lies in the personal data, as much as in the products and services purchased.</p>
<h2 id="most-network-components-are-vulnerable-andor-pre-hacked"><a class="header" href="#most-network-components-are-vulnerable-andor-pre-hacked"><strong>Most network components are vulnerable and/or pre-hacked</strong></a></h2>
<p>Routers, Wifi Bridges are ideal components for hackers to get into network traffic and intercept packets they are interested in. There are claims that more than 50% of routers and network components are vulnerable or hacked. Personally, I can believe this. Man in the middle attacks are easy to do, information can freely be found on the internet (just an example <a href="https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/conduct-a-simple-man-in-the-middle-attack-on-a-wifi-hotspot/">article</a>).</p>
<h2 id="security--privacy-claims-are-void"><a class="header" href="#security--privacy-claims-are-void"><strong>Security &amp; privacy claims are void</strong></a></h2>
<p>Often the claim from a company and reality do not align. E.g. WhatsApp claims that the encryption protocol they use between the WhatsApp applications is end2end encrypted, which is probably true, but the reality is that the application itself is leaking information to centralized servers. This is unfair and misleading information. Most application claims do not correspond with reality. e.g. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/</a> </p>
<h2 id="web-browsers-are-extremely-dangerous"><a class="header" href="#web-browsers-are-extremely-dangerous"><strong>Web browsers are extremely dangerous</strong></a></h2>
<p>Web browsers became our new operating system, they execute javascript code at runtime in the browser. Most attacks happen through this, it's extremely difficult to guard against, because inserting javascript inside your browser experience is still not so hard today. It's a very difficult problem that can not be easily resolved because otherwise the user experience would become too complicated and people would opt-out.</p>
<p>Through the inserted javascript code (often through man in the middle attacks) it's rather easy to get access to lots of valuable information and even pretend to be a user.</p>
<p>SSL encryption is super easy to workaround.</p>
<h2 id="iot-is-a-nightmare-for-any-security-expert"><a class="header" href="#iot-is-a-nightmare-for-any-security-expert"><strong>IoT is a nightmare for any security expert</strong></a></h2>
<p>IoT devices are 99% of the cases based on Linux, the users don’t know what is running on these devices.</p>
<p>There are so many known vulnerabilities inside IoT devices.</p>
<p>We put these IoT devices inside our secure areas sometimes to monitor people e.g. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2021/09/22/widely-used-hikvision-security-cameras-vulnerable-to-remote-hijacking/">security cameras</a> (https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2021/09/22/widely-used-hikvision-security-cameras-vulnerable-to-remote-hijacking/) or print sensitive information (printers). Don’t be mistaken this is very dangerous and numerous attacks have happened this way. Building security at the perimeter is almost impossible because these devices are good at mimicking default allowed communication and find their way outside that way (e.g. mimicking a user on the network who is just going to a standard website).</p>
<p>IoT is inside TV’s, routers, security cameras, medical devices, printers, … today sometimes even a fridge.</p>
<h2 id="its-easy-to-hack-using-existing-vulnerabilities"><a class="header" href="#its-easy-to-hack-using-existing-vulnerabilities"><strong>It's easy to hack, using existing vulnerabilities</strong></a></h2>
<p>Info can be found on the internet and can be done by not even serious experts.</p>

</ul>
<p>I just found these in 2 min google search, it's actually all quite simple and effective.</p>
<p>Sometimes it requires some social engineering or getting people on fake websites but it's a lot less difficult than people might think and it's actually hard to protect against using existing off the shelf components. e.g. firewalls do not help.</p>
<p>I’ve seen kids doing this and even enjoying it because of the feeling of empowerment it gives them.</p>
<h2 id="data-should-not-be-on-user-machines-desktopnotebook"><a class="header" href="#data-should-not-be-on-user-machines-desktopnotebook"><strong>Data should not be on user machines (desktop/notebook)</strong></a></h2>
<p>Many governments today rely on centralized services like Gmail, Google docs, Microsoft office. This leads to a lot of exposure to sensitive information. The information leaks all over the world and ends up in many locations. It's impossible to secure information this way.</p>
<p>Because often existing IT systems are not flexible enough, government instances will turn to these services and sometimes even use their own credit card to get the flexibility they require. This can happen on a small or large scale, even if there are often strict guidelines given that this should not happen.</p>
<p>Often the more regulations introduced the more people will go to systems outside of their government sometimes even the country.</p>
<h2 id="the-cloud-market-leaders-are-sometimes-misleading-their-customers"><a class="header" href="#the-cloud-market-leaders-are-sometimes-misleading-their-customers"><strong>The cloud market leaders are sometimes misleading their customers.</strong></a></h2>
<p>Of course, companies like Microsoft/Google/Amazon will claim privacy and security is important to them, and make misleading statements, but if you look at the small letters around their service levels it turns out not to be such a great story.</p>
<p>Just one example: AWS Quotes on its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When evaluating the security of a cloud solution, it is important for you to understand and distinguish between the security of the cloud, and your security in the cloud. Security of the cloud encompasses the security measures that AWS implements and operates. We are responsible for the security of the cloud. Security in the cloud encompasses the security measures that you implement and operate, related to the AWS services you use. You are responsible for your security in the cloud.<br />
For more information, see the AWS Shared Responsibility webpage. This is not shared responsibility, this just means, we Amazon take NO responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please do note that it's often not even in their control. People using these services are making it insecure by design. Many computers and mobile phones are hacked and make the information accessible to others. Centralized designs are simply more unreliable and unsafe.</p>
<p><strong>Some would claim that even these large organizations like Google are not safe themselves and do not mind making information available. Allow me to not take an opinion here, it's just my intent to show you this possibility.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-centralized-clouds-or-telecom-operators-are-not-private-nor-secure"><a class="header" href="#the-centralized-clouds-or-telecom-operators-are-not-private-nor-secure"><strong>The centralized clouds or telecom operators are NOT PRIVATE NOR SECURE</strong></a></h2>
<p>Most of the info here is harder to find, maybe because it's related to security and google, but we believe that much if the info on wikileaks is factual and might represent reality, e.g. <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/33661/new-snowden-leaks-show-the-nsa-captures-google-data-center-traffic/index.html">Google clouds are connected to NSA and actively searched for</a>. THIS MEANS ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND/RECEIVE ON GOOGLE MAIL AND DOCUMENTS IS NOT PRIVATE NOR SAFE. Please do realize this is NOT ONLY the NSA looking at this, if they can many others can as well and some of them might not do it for the right reasons.</p>
<p>We do know the following for a fact though, all telecom operators in Europe have dedicated racks in their datacenters where all voice &amp; sms traffic from that telecom operator gets routed through. These dedicated racks are owned by different countries in the world. I am not questioning that this might be a good practice but the reality is that this leads to security issues and non intended consequences. For sure there is an ethical question, is it normal that citizens do not realize that they are being spied upon by different governments not related to their own, there is no transparency about this. Again a case can be made that this type of traffic needs to be monitored but why does this have to be done by multiple out of country organizations which might allow other hackers to abuse this situation and it does happen. </p>
<p>It's possible that these monitoring probes are heavily targeted by hackers all over the world and probably compromised.</p>

<p>Many of them don’t feel appreciated by “normal” society and they wanna use their superpowers to work on alternative domains. Hacking gives them a purpose and they become powerful and important.</p>
<p>Hacking can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get access to private information. 
<ul>
<li>Spying on governments and their people.</li>
<li>Can be intellectual property, political information,  <br />
business tactics, defense/military information...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manipulate information 
<ul>
<li>Done much more than we think, done on a massive scale with millions of people at once.</li>
<li>E.g. every search you do in e.g. Google is manipulated for you as a target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compromise important people, to get something in return.</li>
<li>Hack other devices

<li>In most cases, devices are hacked to become a tool to further hack or do denial of service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tools for war
<ul>
<li>Today hacking can be used to do denial of service attacks on e.g. power plants, governments, … Some have happened already, we expect this will be much more the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ransom
<ul>
<li>Most victims do not speak about it, because they don’t want to tell the world, shame.</li>
<li>It's very good business and happens a lot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong></p>
<p>At one point in time, we worked with a large bank, we heard from an insider that they were losing sometimes more than 100m USD on security-related issues and would never admit this or even be open about it. It was just not possible for them to do so, otherwise, they could lose the trust of their customers.</p>
