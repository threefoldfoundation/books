<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/twin_sovereignity_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the current internet system I exist many times, each application provider owns my data and provides functionality they own and let me use in return for my data.</p>
<p>We are digitally sovereign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am me, I am sovereign</li>
<li>I have an identity, I only exist once</li>
<li>What I learn and experience is mine </li>
<li>I do not exist for the benefit of others </li>
<li>I have my own digital skills and capabilities, these are owned by me</li>
<li>Everything I produce is owned by me, and stored by my twin on locations my twin and me know about.</li>
<li>Because the capabilities are owned by me, they can easily be extended and I can use them everywhere, it makes my life easier, I don't have to learn different tools each time I enter another event</li>
<li>I am capable of making my own decisions</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/my_freeflow_life_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Every person owns a Digital Twin, which is your personal Internet Gateway Application. This Digital Twin (also called Freeflow Twin) is running on a location of your choice. Each twin is owned by only one owner. The Twin has lots of capabilities and serves its owner 24h a day, 7/7. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin.</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/intro_twin_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A twin owns your data and your identity. All data is stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. You own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.</p>
<p>And when you die you can handover your digital heritage to your beloved ones.</p>
<p>Each Twin has following capabilities:</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/capabilities_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Twins are unique, they talk directlty to each other, no centralized datacenters or server farms needed.</p>

<p><img src="mytwin/intro/img/welcome_back_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Lets make a comparison of how our digital systems work in relation to how we do things in day to day life, in this case we are comparing with an educational event.</p>
<p>We hope you will see how current web experiences are and not logical, they are designed to lock us in ,and treat us like their product rather than being only at our service.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-2-way--the-current-internet"><a class="header" href="#the-web-2-way--the-current-internet">The Web 2 way = the current internet.</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to an educational event, it is very affordable, maybe even free</li>
<li>They ask me to change clothes and use theirs, so we all look alike</li>
<li>I am not allowed to bring or use my own tools. They give me theirs, a pen, headset, glasses, and a notebook, which I am asked to return at the end</li>
<li>The event creators keep my freedom limited and overwhelm me with audio/video experience, if I am allowed to chose, it is all based on their scripts</li>
<li>They drive me around from activity to activity in the experience, its all very well done and impressive</li>
<li>They track everything I do, to make sure they can adjust the experience to have me even more impressed next time, because they want me to come back</li>
<li>If I take notes it is in their notebook, but I can't take it with me, if they destroy it its gone</li>
<li>I am happy, because it's all incredible and very well done</li>
<li>I take the commercial content for granted because yeh, you know I got this for a low cost, they need to make money too</li>
<li>If I want to get back to the content of the event, I need to pay again and go through the event again</li>
<li>If I would go to another (similar) event from another provider, I would have to restart from scratch, I would have to get other tools, another notebook, I cannot reuse what I have produced on the first event.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the good thing is, I don't have to think that much and it is very addictive, they learn very well what we like and keep on improving constantly, so we want to come back.</p>
<h3 id="the-web-3-way"><a class="header" href="#the-web-3-way">The Web 3 way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All as above, but the event is not owned by a company but by all of us</li>
<li>We have a vote in how the event should be created</li>
<li>It is at least better because if, working properly, it iss a consensus owned experience</li>
<li>Now at least we have the feeling we co-own how the event is being created</li>
<li>We will realize its all very hard to run a real democracy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-freeflow-way"><a class="header" href="#the-freeflow-way">The FreeFlow Way</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I go to the education event</li>
<li>They check if the tools I have are up-to-date for the experience they have created. If not they tell me where I can get new tools (upgrade them), but they remain mine. These tools are my core digital capabilities or skills,</li>
<li>I can now go into the event and experience 'the experience' as prepared for me, I walk freely around, I take notes on my notebook, so I can use it later,</li>
<li>I have a lot of freedom where to go, and what to do first,</li>
<li>I can use many more of my capabilities, I don't have to learn new ways to do something, because the tools (capabilities) are mine. I can dance, sing, run, jump, ...</li>
<li>I will be able to do things the creators of the event did not foresee, there is so much joy and freedom, I am creative and I am alive,</li>
<li>Its easier to make friends, because I can bring my friends in a much easier way, because they already have the required capabilities,</li>
<li>I can give authenticity to the experience, my feedback matters from out of my own power,</li>
<li>It might be I have to think and act more myself, I am using my tools (capabilities) in the incredible experience as created by the education event organizers,</li>
<li>I will be super happy because I feel empowered, I am less addicted maybe because I am less controlled, but I know whatever I learned is for me to keep, I feel productive because I am allowed to use my capabilities, and my data was enriched by me..</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: This event can be single owned or co-owned (like in web3).</p>

<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>

<p>each FFK gives you the right to give away 3 other FFK’s to people who cannot afford to buy or rent an FFK, or to your friends. A free FFK is the same as a normal FFK but has less storage &amp; compute capacity, and certain features may not be available on a free FFK. </p>

<h2 id="ffks-are-scarce"><a class="header" href="#ffks-are-scarce">FFK's are scarce</a></h2>
<p>At start there are only 1.000.000 FFKs available. The DAO will have to approve more of them later and the price is expected to be different. </p>
<p>From every initial FFK sold 30% goes to ThreeFold (technology provider) and 70% goes to FreeFlow Treasury. Do note there is only a certain amount of storage &amp; compute capacity included, if users go over it they will need more CHI (The FreeFlow Internet Token).</p>
<p>For people who don’t want to buy a FFK they can also rent one that will be at a rate of 5 USD per month to start with, the owner of the FFK gets this rent, this will be arranged from the DAO.</p>
<p>The DAO will use the treasury to fund development work for the FreeFlow Project as well as help projects to build value on top (experience) by means of grants.</p>
<p>(*) FreeFlow DAO is the ultimate governance mechanism of the FreeFlow DAO and as such might always change certain of the above described mechanisms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>how</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>install Algorand wallet (we recommend https://perawallet.app/)</li>
<li>buy algo to get your Algorand wallet minimally funded (10 USD or so is ok)</li>
<li>buy USDC on algorand (can swap from other currencies, buy from credit card, ...)</li>
<li>buy CHI, visit our CHI buying page (coming soon).</li>

<p>You need some TFT, there are quite some ways how to buy TFT, e.g. there is gettft.com</p>
<p><strong>how</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>install Algorand wallet (we recommend https://perawallet.app/)</li>
<li>buy algo to get your Algorand wallet minimally funded (10 USD or so is ok)</li>
<li>go to our CHI buying page, ask for QR code </li>
<li>go to your ThreeFold Connect wallet, scan the QR code, TFT will now be send to the FreeFlow treasury and CHI will be returned to your wallet.</li>
<li>CHI will now be in your wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remarks"><a class="header" href="#remarks">Remarks</a></h2>
<p>(*) CHI can also be bought with TFT, TFT is the token as created by farming on the ThreeFold grid, ThreeFold grid is the underlying network we use for FreeFlow, a Threefold farmer can exchange to CHI at the rate of the day (now 2 TFT for 1 CHI). This means every CHI is the result of farming !!!</p>
<p>(**) When you buy using USDC, the treasury will use this USDC to buy TFT and then switch to CHI. There are no CHI minted !!! The price of TFT and CHI will change over time.</p>
<p>(***) The exchange rate between CHI and TFT is defined regularly by the DAO to be market conform. We start with 1 CHI = 2 TFT.</p>

<p>There is a DEFI and Auction system built into the FreeFlow Chain which allows everyone to buy and sell their CHI and FFKs.</p>
<h2 id="defi"><a class="header" href="#defi">DEFI</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity pool assets provided in CHI, FFK's, TFT and chosen stable coin e.g. USDC.</li>
<li>The liquidity pool is managed by a DAO and the Buy/Sales prices and used DEFI algorithms for the different currency pairs are defined on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The difference between sales and buy is called the spread and is 100% to the benefit to the Liquidity Pool providers, this means it can be very rewarding to provide liquidity to such a pool.</li>
<li>At start the DEFI system is very simple and will mainly be geared towards people buying their CHI's.</li>
<li>Everyone (also the FF Treasury) can withdraw and fund their assets (digital currencies or tokens) to the pool.</li>
<li>The pool is a very fair mechanism (more fair compared to the current AMM based liquidity pools in our opinion). The prices and used algorithms are always known in advance and everyone can go in/out whenever they want. Their reward is always in line to their participation per every transaction which happened at that specific time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auction-system-q2-2023"><a class="header" href="#auction-system-q2-2023">Auction System (Q2 2023)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>once every period (probably every week or 2 weeks), people can leave their bids with the Auction system.</li>

<p>We believe the above methods are more safe and fair for all participants in the FreeFlow Ecosystem as such we did not choose yet to support AMM (Automatic MarketMaking) or OrderBook based trading as typically found on many blockchains.</p>
<p>We chose to disadvantage liquidity in line to valuation protection as we believe longer term this is more beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Of course we are a decentralized organization and as such we might together define to change these rules.</p>

<p>The Twin is a powerful communicator.</p>
<p>Features right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>CHAT</li>
<li>VIDEO CONFERENCING</li>
<li>FORUM</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Any communication you do is directly between you and your peer, twin to twin. You don't need any centralized service to allow you to communicate on a global level.</p>
<p>It is Unique as all communication fill follow the shortest path.</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/img/communicate2_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>All the communication skills will eventually be available in all experiences.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap-vs-experiences"><a class="header" href="#roadmap-vs-experiences">Roadmap vs Experiences</a></h2>
<p>There will be hundreds (thousands) of experiences eventually, but we mapped our capabilities to some first ones to get started with.</p>

<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/chat_people_invite_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Private version of the chat:</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/chat_overview.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The chat communication tools presents a simple interface to manage both individuals and group messaging. The interface presented is very similar to mainstream messaging platforms but works in a very different way.</p>
<p>Centralized messaging services always have a third party (company) involved.  A message would follow the following path:</p>
<h2 id="chat-architecture"><a class="header" href="#chat-architecture">Chat Architecture</a></h2>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    subgraph Individual A;
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALA --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA;
    subgraph Messaging provider;
    MESSAGINGA(messaging platform);
    end;
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA;
    subgraph Individual B;
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB;
    end;
</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the messaging provider sits in the middle and has access to all messages passing through its messaging platform. It means that messaging providers can (or can be told to) do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do machine learning on message content and/or message volume, frequency, size and all sort of other data</li>
<li>expose, compile and sell machine learning outcome (metadata)</li>
<li>provide access to meta data or actual messaging information to other companies or governing bodies</li>
<li>and much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous documentaries and news stories out there that prove that this is the case. A decentralized messaging platform avoids all of this.</p>
<p>Decentralized messaging send and receive messages from private messaging instances to the receiving party's private (messaging) instance. It doesn't have a central man in the middle. There are two main types of decentralized messaging in this capability:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>private chat</em>: private entity to private entity</li>
<li><em>group chat</em>: one private entity creates and <strong>hosts</strong> the &quot;group&quot;, and all the other members are invited to post and receive message from this group. The entity that starts the group also sets the groups &quot;rules&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-chat"><a class="header" href="#private-chat">Private Chat</a></h3>
<p>With private chat we mean a chat between two entities. These entities could be individuals, organizations, companies, clubs, basically anything.  The chat is a one to one chat, and information (data) is exchanged between two private, secure and personal messaging platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>a chat starts with inviting the other persons twin (messaging and other services platform ), in this case the twin of the other person needs to be found and sent an invite message.</li>
<li>if the person accepts the invite, a secure connection allows messages to be send person to person without a third party in the middle. Only the (twins of) two people involved have access to he message data (metadata).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| TWINA
    TWINA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA
    end
    TWINA(Twin A) .-&gt;|secure network| TWINB(Twin B)
    subgraph Individual B
    TWINB .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|Browser| TWINB
    TWINB --&gt;|secure network| TWINA
    end
</pre>
<p>The chat functionality allows most (if not all) of the standard functionalities known from many centralized platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>send text message</li>
<li>send voice message</li>
<li>message reply</li>
<li>message forward</li>
<li>send photo/file/</li>
</ul>
<p>From the chat function you can also initiate video conference, and have control over accepting, deleting and blocking users.</p>
<h3 id="group-chat"><a class="header" href="#group-chat">Group Chat</a></h3>
<p>Group chat is unique to this peer2peer chat platform. The group functionality is initiated by the group creator and this action creates the group function on the initiators' messaging platform (twin). The group is then formed by inviting other entities and when they accept they get 'read and write' access in the group messaging functionality.</p>

<h2 id="communication-tool-video"><a class="header" href="#communication-tool-video">Communication tool: Video</a></h2>
<p>A truly peer2peer video chat experience starting from your digital twin to your guests', without stopping by a data center in between. Of course, free.</p>
<p>Current world video conferencing services use service provider and centralized software installations to present services to businesses and consumers. Take for example two users in Zanzibar who wish to communicate through zoom (or google meet, or Microsoft Teams, principle stays the same), they will connect from their laptops/phones to a centralized service, and the traffic will be routed from both of their devices to a centralized service datacenter far away.</p>
<p>In principle this looks like</p>
<pre class="mermaid">graph LR
    
    subgraph Individual A
    INDIVIDUALA(Person A)
    end
    INDIVIDUALA .-&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA
    MESSAGINGA --&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALA
    subgraph Video service provider
    MESSAGINGA(Video service platform)
    end
    INDIVIDUALB(Person B) --&gt;|browser| MESSAGINGA
    subgraph Individual B
    MESSAGINGA .-&gt;|browser| INDIVIDUALB
    end
</pre>
<p>And if we expand this to a world map it would look somethingg like this:</p>
<!--

<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/videoconference_central_1.png" alt="" />)</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: pictures are too small, need to make new ones, also revisit text &amp; flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not lead to create the best experience, and overall it is very wasteful with a number of (scarce) resources.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to have a video conference solution that works peer2peer.</p>
<!--
mermaid source in: ./includes/private_video.md
-->
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><img src="mytwin/skills/extra/img/example" alt="" /></p>

    TWINA(Twin A) .-&gt;|Browser| INDIVIDUALC
    TWINA(Twin A) .-&gt;|Browser| INDIVIDUALD
    subgraph Individual B

    INDIVIDUALC(Person C) --&gt;|Browser| TWINA
    end
    subgraph Individual D

    end
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: not ok</p>

<p>If we build a video conferencing system that follows this principle we can be much more effective.  Back to the example earlier, the two people in Zanzibar would be able to communicate as follows:</p>

<p>Browsing the internet present risks. There are many sites which have malicious codes embedded in what look like harmless web pages. These malicious contents get uploaded to your browser and might trick you in agreeing malicious codes in your local browser or you local machine. This is a fairly common practice and people are being tricked into providing information of access to others which they should not.</p>
<p>The Surf Safe option of the twin provides a virtual browser on the twin that browses the internet on behalf off the person who operates the twin.</p>

<p>Lacking the tools to enable effective and sustainable
collaboration and sharing between children, teachers and the school.</p>
<p>Traditional marketplaces use money to measure the exchange of values and resources. However, money cannot be used as recognition for the children’s contributions in the school.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying our gratitude points as recognition for their contributions and positive exchanges enabled a remarkable impact and flow of values.
Children, teachers and parents support each other, their school and staff resulting in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift from passive listeners to mutual learning through peer-to-peer teaching</li>
<li>Kids extend their real life capabilities by practicing new skills</li>
<li>Kids are significantly more engaged and happy</li>
<li>Increased capacity of the school to effectively handle its objectives</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usecase-3--social-delivery"><a class="header" href="#usecase-3--social-delivery">Usecase 3:  Social Delivery</a></h2>
<p><strong>Enterprises to NGOs</strong></p>
<p>Large businesses are storing unimaginable excess inventory of goods.</p>
<p>Goods that were returned by customers, didn’t sell during the season or simply finished their use even though they are still in great condition.</p>
<p>Those resources are stuck, expensive to store, or dumped and no one benefits from it.</p>
<p>Flow of enterprises’ excess capacity becomes an income for NGOs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive the valuable goods (in-kind donations)</li>
<li>Upload the goods to the Social Delivery (“SD”) marketplace</li>
<li>Distribute points to the approved NGOs as a monthly budget</li>
<li>NGOs shop in the SD marketplace for things they really need at the time needed NGOs 1. exchange their points for chosen merchandises and equipment</li>
<li>NGOs distribute these items to the communities they support</li>
<li>NGOs saves significant amount of money</li>
<li>Saved money enable the NGOs to better deliver on their core mission</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tax credits for “in-kind donations” motivate enterprises to further participate and benefit for doing good out of zero value inventory that cost them money to store or eliminate.</em></p>
<p>We demonstrated that applying Floweavers resulted in a win-win-situation both for the enterprises and the NGOs. The capacities and inventories that were stuck at the enterprises were donated and uploaded to the market place and became very useful for the NGOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating NGOs received a monthly budget of $2,156 - $10,385 in points</li>
<li>With this budget of points the NGOs could order online items that they needed</li>
<li>NGOs were enabled to also offer help (and not just get donations)</li>
<li>Keep their fiat money to better fulfill their core mission</li>
<li>Businesses linked their in-kind donations towards their corporate responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="usecase-4-community-shipping"><a class="header" href="#usecase-4-community-shipping">Usecase 4: Community Shipping</a></h2>
<p>We developed a unique P2P delivery system using reward points.</p>
<p>Use case of a Peer2Peer community shipping:</p>
<p>Betty needed to pick up an item from a member, on the way back home she delivered an item to another member who lives near her, and gained additional points for it. The way it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betty is scheduled to meet Lee to pick up an item</li>
<li>Lee asked Betty if she can also take another item for someone that lives next to her</li>
<li>Betty agreed and picked up two items: one for herself, one for another member -Rachel</li>
<li>Rachel contacted Betty to schedule a pickup time to get the item</li>
<li>Rachel rewarded Betty with points for delivering the item closer to her home.</li>

<p>State of the art rendering and experiences beyond e-commerce and marketing. A metaverse built by and for the people using it, with worthwhile capabilities that enhance your virtual experience. </p>
<p>A high quality metaverse experience cannot be delivered from far away datacenter, just like a very high resolution and action intense games cannot be delivered by central large datacenters.  Local gaming consoles are top of the market and present the best gaming experience to gamers. Gaming consoles are local to gamers for optimum performance and experience. For immersive metaverse high quality and responsive metaverse experiences you need local data compute and storage and GPU rendering.</p>
<h3 id="local-gpu-rendering"><a class="header" href="#local-gpu-rendering">Local GPU Rendering</a></h3>
<p>OurVerse’s proximity by ThreeFold’s edge computing allows rendering proximity (low latency) and speed unmatched in the industry.</p>
<p>This allows streaming and graphic rendering at super high speeds with pixel perfect imagery, making OurVerse the first metaverse to achieve this status.</p>
<p>Even on mobile devices, GPU rendering shows quality previously not available for such experiences.</p>
<h2 id="metaverse-is-making-remote-local"><a class="header" href="#metaverse-is-making-remote-local">Metaverse is making remote local</a></h2>
<p>The metaverse allows to create physical world experiences and in general things we are used to available in the digital space.  We do so much in our personal and professional lifes online that is replaces a lot of physcial times being with others.  In order to make that digital online life more like our day to day physical life.  Email, Todo lists, video conferences they can all be redone and redesigned into somthing that is more personal and provides everyone with more detailed input and feedback about the situation we are in.</p>
<h2 id="example-experiences"><a class="header" href="#example-experiences">Example experiences</a></h2>
<h3 id="personal-todo-list"><a class="header" href="#personal-todo-list">Personal ToDo list</a></h3>
<p>The metaverse presents real work experiences in a new an innovative way.  For example a wall with ToDo list functionality will present different personal ToDo lists for any that is looking at the same wall. Also, when two people want to share their todo lists they can make their private todo list viewable for other digital avatars in the digital space.

<p>Covid-19 has put digital meetings in everyones agenda.  From business meetings to school classes, we all have been using industry standard video conferencing tools.  This is a step forward from having audio conferences only, but a lot can be improved if all participants are part of and in a virtual space where everyone has 3D virtual representation and experiences the same (virtual) environment as one would in the real world in a conference room.</p>
<p>This is make possible in the metaverse and proximity of the virtual world rendering makes the experiences high quality and latency free.

<p><img src="mytwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Education is a sector that still relies on traditional teaching methods, a teacher, a classroom, a black (or white) board, books, paper and pencils. This method has been in use for hundreds of years. In the current digital age, the classroom can be a digital classroom, with a teacher teaching while all of the rest of the required items can be digitised.</p>
<p>Traditional learning is based on a live teacher, teaching an audience in a classroom. This works, however it has a number of restrictions which makes that work for a limited number of pupils, and not everywhere, because of the necessity to have live teachers and pupils. In this digital world we can record and present the learning materials in a digital manner to a much larger audience than a single classroom.  Classes, or better as curriculum can be digitised and shared along a much larger group of pupils spanning a vast geographic area.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that remote teaching is possible and that the current technology allow for this. This experience was still based on the standard teacher - pupil relationship and numbers for live teaching. Another technology, a video sharing platform has proven that storing videos and sharing videos is a effective manner to reach a very large number of viewers (youtube.com).</p>
<p><img src="mytwin/experiences/sikana/img/sikana2_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Taking the learnings from both of these current use cases, we have created Sikana. Improve your life - one skill at a time. Sikana is a free education platform, with more than 4 billion views, aiming to deliver quality education and necessary skills to everyone. The software can be installed on threefold nodes and deployed regionally so that bandwidth requirements are minimised because it is a decentralized online education platform.</p>

<p>To scale such a solution for many classrooms in many schools and in many different regions put enormous requirements and stress on the central video sharing platform.</p>
<p>Decentralized video sharing as an education platform will lower the requirements on the education / video sharing platform and creates, stores and distributes educational content from within a region, or even from within a school. This brings a solution to educate everywhere, even if there is no internet connection. A simple Wifi router that connects devices to the educational platform is all that is needed.</p>

<p>A FFK is your key which gives access to a FreeFlow Twin.</p>
<p>You need one to benefit from all the FreeFlow experiences (now and in the future).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The value of a digital life today per year is +10.000 USD (as estimated by some marketing companies) but in reality it's much higher, FreeFlow DAO is selling 1m FreeFlow Keys at 200 to 60 USD per FreeFlow key for a lifetime.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>By having an FreeFlow Key you get following direct benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>All skills and experiences as mentioned in this document.
<ul>
<li>Many more experiences being built, we will have everything required to allow you to have a safe &amp; private internet experience as complete as everything you have access to today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access to endless amounts of information free of charge (education, knowledge).</li>
<li>The ability to exchange anything for everything (money to money, money to service, money to goods, …) directly from supplier to buyer. This gives you at least 3x more buying power compared to today.</li>
<li>Ability to keep your data safe for ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of this is huge, there are 2 ways how to get to an FreeFlow Key</p>
<ul>
<li>You can rent a FreeFlow Key: 5 USD worth of CHI per month (not possible yet)</li>
<li>You can buy a FreeFlow Key: 200-60 USD worth of CHI, lifetime valid</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="freeflow/network/tokens/../buy/buy_my_twin.html">here</a> for more information about how to buy a FFK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FFK are digital assets as stored on the Algorand blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="tokenomics"><a class="header" href="#tokenomics">Tokenomics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are only 1.000.000 FFK's in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>FFKs are the alternative to a license fee for having access to technology
<ul>
<li>30% of the sales goes to ThreeFold (see www.threefold.io) to keep on further creation of the tech.</li>
<li>70% goes to the FreeFlow Treasury of the FreeFlow DAO which will use to fund the growth of ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FFK's can only be bought by <a href="freeflow/network/tokens/chi.html">CHI's</a>, see <a href="freeflow/network/tokens/../buy/buy_my_twin.html">here</a></li>
<li>CHI's can only be farmed or bought with TFT (the utility token of ThreeFold).</li>
<li>FFKs can be rented from the Freeflow DAO or any FFK holder at a to be defined price (prob around 5 USD per month). </li>
<li>If there are not enough FFK available for rent, then the DAO can create FFK's for rental only purpose and owned by treasury.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relation-to-chi"><a class="header" href="#relation-to-chi">Relation to CHI</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Price of CHI at start is 0.1 USD. CHI is the utility token of freeflow and represents Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold grid. CHI is created by <a href="freeflow/network/tokens/../farming/farming_intro.html">FreeFlow Farmers</a>. You can buy CHI from the Algorand Blockchain. Be aware that the price per FFK in CHI will be variable over time as CHI price changes in USD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each CHI links into the ThreeFold Token called TFT, at this stage the currency exchange rate is 0.5 CHI corresponds to 1 TFT. Every TFT holder can exchange their TFT for CHI at this rate, or the other way around. ThreeFold is the capacity layer on top of which FreeFlow has been built.</p>
<h2 id="internet-resources-available-for-a-ffk-enabled-twin"><a class="header" href="#internet-resources-available-for-a-ffk-enabled-twin">Internet Resources Available for a FFK Enabled Twin</a></h2>
<p>A FreeFlow Twin linked to a FFK has following default resources available for the first 1 year: 0.1 CU and 0.1 SU. All additional resources used or after the first year the twin owner has to use his/her CHI to pay the energy fees (storage, compute and network). All the capabilities are for free for ever and all upgrades as developed by FF will remain free of charge as well.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chi"><a class="header" href="#chi">CHI</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/tfgrid/farming/threefold__grid_new_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>CHI is the FreeFlow utility token which is used to reward farmers for making compute, network and storage capacity available as well as to allow users to buy this resource from the FF Network. All of this is being arranged and tracked by the FreeFlow Blockchain called FFChain.</p>
<p>FreeFlow is running as a side chain to ThreeFold and CHI tokens can be exchanged between ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) and CHI.</p>
<h2 id="chi-is-scarce"><a class="header" href="#chi-is-scarce">CHI is scarce</a></h2>
<p>At start FF sells 5,000 nodes extra (extra compared to existing capacity of ThreeFold grid).</p>
<ul>
<li>5.000 nodes results in 100-150.000.000 CHI over 5 years.</li>
<li>5.000 nodes enable +- 250.000 to 500.000 users with their digital life.</li>
<li>Each user renting a twin needs about 50 CHI per month to do so, this results in the requirement of 300.000.000 CHI per year (if they would hold it per year).</li>
<li>1m users buying FFK's (the twins) at these conditions, results in +-1.000.000.000 CHI.</li>
<li>Clearly there are not enough CHI's which means the CHI price needs to go up as the network grows to compensetate for this requirement.</li>
<li>As more nodes are added to the network, the more CHI is needed the CHI price will have to go up to compensate for the extra demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="farming-reward-calculation-details"><a class="header" href="#farming-reward-calculation-details">Farming Reward Calculation Details</a></h2>
<p>Each FreeFlow node has a certain amount of compute, storage and network resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute Capacity (CPU)</li>
<li>Memory Capacity (RAM)</li>
<li>Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)</li>
<li>Network Capacity (Bandwidth, IP Addresses)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reward is calculated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TFT earned per month = 
CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
+ SU farmed * SU farming rewards
+ NU used * NU farming rewards
+ IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reward for above items are linked (pegged) to the USD</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Unit</th><th>USD</th><th>Unit</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td>Public IPv4 Address</td><td>0.005</td><td>per IP address, calculated per hour</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>For the predefined nodes as defined on the &quot;buy node&quot; page the rewards are fixed and described in this manual and expressed in CHI but pegged to USD.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The rewards get expressed in CHI but are pegged to the USD and registered in the FreeFlow Blockchain (FFChain) at FreeFlow Node registration time in USD. If the CHI vs USD price changes then the amount of CHI will be adjusted in relation to the USD price.</li>
<li>Rewards are calculated from Resource Units,  see below.</li>
<li>Rewards for NU and IP Addresses are dynamic
The FFChain tracks capacity utilization and as such the reward can be calculated for the Farmer.</li>
<li>All Internet capacity farmed is rewarded on a monthly basis but only unlocked after 6 months, in case the farmer removes the node before 5 years the last 6 months of farmed tokens will not be released to farmer but to FreeFlow Treasury.</li>
<li>Minimum SLA = Service Level Agreement needs to be achieved before CHI can be rewarded.</li>
<li>The FreeFlow DAO can decide to change the rewards and needs community majority vote for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Zero-OS and FFChain software translates resource units (CRU, MRU, HRU, SRU) into cloud units (CU, SU) for farming reward calculation.</p>
<h4 id="compute"><a class="header" href="#compute">Compute</a></h4>
<p>For farming, 1 CU equals:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 virtual CPUs with a maximum over subscription of 4 CPUs and minimum required memory of 4GB. </li>
<li>An over subscription of 4 CPUs remains still gentle as we understand many other providers use more.</li>
<li>There needs to be at least 50GB SSD per CU, if not there is penalty for nr of CU, reasoning is that otherwise people cannot deploy their VM's or Containers if there would not be minimal SSD.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">cu = min((mru - 1) / 4, cru * 4 / 2, sru / 50)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>1 GB of memory is subtracted for the operating system to function.</li>
<li>please note minimal passmark per CU (with 4GB mem), needs to be 1500 passmark, this is not being checked today but might be done in future. If your chosen CPU has less than 1000 passmark per CU (of 4 GB mem), it could be your final CU's will be lower once that feature is introduced.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="storage"><a class="header" href="#storage">Storage</a></h4>
<p>For farming, 1 SU equals to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.2 TB of HD capacity (which can deliver 1 TB of net usable storage) </li>
<li>200 GB of SSD capacity with a buffer of 20%</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">su = hru / 1200 + sru * 0.8 / 200
</code></pre>
<h4 id="resource-units"><a class="header" href="#resource-units">Resource Units</a></h4>
<p>Resource units (RU) are used to measure and convert capacity on the hardware level into cloud units: CU &amp; SU see above.</p>

<p>These are raw capacity resources as measured by the ThreeFold software running on Zero-OS which is the cloud operating system as developped by ThreeFold.</p>
<h2 id="important-chi-utilization-remarks"><a class="header" href="#important-chi-utilization-remarks">Important CHI Utilization Remarks</a></h2>
<p>CHI's are needed to use the Internet Capacity as farmed in the FreeFlow Network.</p>
<p>The price for CU,SU and NU capacity is defined by the FreeFlow DAO.</p>
<p>The CHI's used for utilization are distributed as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>10% to FreeFlow Validators</li>
<li>10% to ThreeFold Foundation</li>
<li>35% gets burned (this is the minimal burn)</li>
<li>45% to the FreeFlow DAO Treasury (which can decide to burn or use for promotion or FF network development purposes). DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>For deploying the FreeFlow Twin's CU/SU and NU resources are required, the FreeFlow Chain will arrange this energy (CHI) flow in line with above specifications.</p>

<p>Share itt is an existing platform: The Shareitt platform makes it fun and easy to exchange second-hand used or new items.  This implementation of Shareitt is not a centralized platform on which all items are listed on a single site, no this decentralized version is where the user manages its own platform for their os items on sale.</p>
<!--
Insert a graph that shows that everyone has their own marketplace own which they can sell anything.  Meant for communities to enhance local trade without loosing control. 
-->
<h3 id="next-generation-marketplace"><a class="header" href="#next-generation-marketplace">Next Generation Marketplace</a></h3>
<p>Shareitt allows users to exchange items they don't need or are no longer using, no matter the type of item, its size or worth. Each item uploaded to the marketplace gets its own unique value in Shareitt points and becomes available to tens of thousands of users who can request the item in exchange for points. Points earned then allow users to receive items they want from other users, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="currency-out-points-in"><a class="header" href="#currency-out-points-in">Currency: Out, Points: In</a></h3>
<p>Shareitt commerce is not based on money. Shareitt points are accumulated by users in different ways and may then be &quot;spent&quot; in our dynamic marketplace, which has tens of thousands of items in different categories. The best way to earn Shareitt points is to upload as many items as possible and exchange them – for points - with other users.</p>
<h3 id="substantial-social-catalog"><a class="header" href="#substantial-social-catalog">Substantial social catalog</a></h3>
<p>The items on the Shareitt platform are uploaded to the marketplace by users, in a quick, simple process. The more detailed the item description, the more attractive it is for other users. High-quality pictures, detailed descriptions, diverse categories, and great points value - generate thousands of exchanges every day. Together, we are creating an extensive social catalog being used by tens of thousands of users.</p>
<h3 id="so-many-gifts"><a class="header" href="#so-many-gifts">So many gifts!</a></h3>
<p>When you register, each user is awarded with 100 points as a welcome gift so that you may enjoy the experience on your first visit. In order to earn Shareitt points, we recommended uploading and offering as many items as possible to other users. Another way to earn points is by redeeming gifts received for your actions on the platform: uploading items, giving, exchanging, granting wishes, inviting friends, and more.</p>

<p><img src="theinternet/img/theinternet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. </p>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, cabling or radio links, repeaters, modems etc. An Internet Protocol address (IP address), a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, enables us to the Internet Protocol for communication and store/run data on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, e-mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony (calls), file sharing, and streaming media services.</p>
<p>Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in centralized data centers owned by a few large corporations. This centralized model is inefficient, as through it's centralized model, if the main servers go down, the whole system experiences downtime. Hundreds of downtime events have been recorded throughout the last few years. Also, given these companies own the data centers, they also own the data that is contained in them and use it for profit reasons. </p>

<p>More than 500 undersea cables and thousands more terrestrial networks connect us all together digitally. These cables carry our data between server and recipient. While satellites also play a role in connectivity, without cables it's safe to say the global Internet would not be what it is today.</p>

<h1 id="the-internet-data-centers"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-data-centers">The Internet Data Centers</a></h1>
<p>Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:</p>
<h2 id="centralization"><a class="header" href="#centralization">Centralization</a></h2>
<p>The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h2>
<p>It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model.</p>
<h2 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage an around 205 TWh of energy - more than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>The current IT stack depends on human infallibility and as such, human error has been considered the primary cause of 95% of cybersecurity breaches. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information.</p>
<h2 id="cannot-support-future-demand"><a class="header" href="#cannot-support-future-demand">Cannot Support Future Demand</a></h2>
<p>To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will need to be built and will consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.</p>

<p><img src="theinternet/img/internet_bandwidth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet today is constructed in a centralized way. The hyperscale data centers that form the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure play a massive role in our digital lives, and they are often located far from users, particularly those living in developing countries or regions. Each time we take an online action such as posting a photo or sending a message, the data is transmitted from our device to that centralized data center, and to the person or persons on the other end. So, you can begin to see how proximity to these servers plays a role in the end user experience.</p>
<p>Internet bandwidth refers to the amount of information or data that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for speed, but they are not the same. Whereas bandwidth is how much information you receive in a given time, speed is how fast that information is received.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of filling a swimming pool with water. If the hose has a wide circumference, more water can flow than if the hose were narrow. In this instance, water is the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows is the speed.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into both bandwidth and speed. An end-to-end network path usually consists of multiple connections, each with different bandwidth capacity. And the link with the lowest bandwidth can limit the overall capacity of all connections in the path. When data travels shorter distances, this is less of a factor. Network congestion (usage) is also a major factor. And it's pretty clear to see how by traveling long distances, this would become a bigger problem.</p>
