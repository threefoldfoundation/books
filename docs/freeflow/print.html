<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>

<p><img src="network/buy/img/own_your_twin.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each twin you buy is represented by a token as an NFT, this token is called a 'FFK' = FreeFlow Key, as in your key to a digital life.</p>
<p>You can buy more than one FFK and keep them for later, or give or re-sell them to your friends.</p>
<p>A FFK is valuable, it gives you access to a digital life for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Some estimate that our digital life is worth thousands of USD per year, whatif you can own your digital life for only 10 USD per month, wouldn't that be better?</p>

<li>price for 1 Rented FreeFlow Key (FFK) will be 5-10 USD per month</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>In other words its much more cost effective to own then to rent and you can always resell.</em></p>
<p>SOON: you will be able to go onto the Freeflow portal and reserve your twin.</p>

<p><strong>SPECIAL, YOU CAN GIFT 3 TWINS per TWIN bought:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>each FFK gives you the right to give away 3 other FFK’s to people who cannot afford to buy or rent an FFK, or to your friends. A free FFK is the same as a normal FFK but has less storage &amp; compute capacity, and certain features may not be available on a free FFK. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This will be enabled next year (2023).</em></p>
<h2 id="ffks-are-scarce"><a class="header" href="#ffks-are-scarce">FFK's are scarce</a></h2>
<p>At start there are only 1.000.000 FFKs available. The DAO will have to approve more of them later and the price is expected to be different. </p>
<p>From every initial FFK sold 30% goes to ThreeFold (technology provider) and 70% goes to FreeFlow Treasury. Do note there is only a certain amount of storage &amp; compute capacity included, if users go over it they will need more CHI (The FreeFlow Internet Token).</p>
<p>For people who don’t want to buy a FFK they can also rent one that will be at a rate of 5 USD per month to start with, the owner of the FFK gets this rent, this will be arranged from the DAO.</p>
<p>The DAO will use the treasury to fund development work for the FreeFlow Project as well as help projects to build value on top (experience) by means of grants.</p>
<p>(*) FreeFlow DAO is the ultimate governance mechanism of the FreeFlow DAO and as such might always change certain of the above described mechanisms.</p>

<p>Farming means you buy  a freeflow node and you host this node in your home or any other location of your choice. </p>
<p>Each node produces internet capacity for the people around you, which allows them to host their digital life on your box.</p>
<p><img src="network/farming/img/becomefarmer_2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>By owning a FreeFlow node you will be rewarded in CHI.</p>

<p>Anyone can become a Farmer, and there is no technical knowledge required. FreeFlow uses ThreeFold’s autonomous system which does all the heavy lifting, making it easy for anyone to join (learn more in https://www.threefold.io/).</p>
<p>Costs to provide Internet capacity to allow FreeFlow twins to be hosted:</p>
<ul>
<li>The computer and storage hardware required (see our nodes)</li>
<li>Electrical costs to power the farm.</li>
<li>Potential cost of equipment to support larger farming setups such as data centers (ventilation, monitoring, electrical wiring, etc).</li>

<li>install Algorand wallet (we recommend https://perawallet.app/)</li>
<li>buy algo to get your Algorand wallet minimally funded (10 USD or so is ok)</li>
<li>go to our CHI buying page, ask for QR code </li>
<li>go to your ThreeFold Connect wallet, scan the QR code, TFT will now be send to the FreeFlow treasury and CHI will be returned to your wallet.</li>
<li>CHI will now be in your wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remarks"><a class="header" href="#remarks">Remarks</a></h2>
<p>(*) CHI can also be bought with TFT, TFT is the token as created by farming on the ThreeFold grid, ThreeFold grid is the underlying network we use for FreeFlow, a Threefold farmer can exchange to CHI at the rate of the day (now 2 TFT for 1 CHI). This means every CHI is the result of farming !!!</p>
<p>(**) When you buy using USDC, the treasury will use this USDC to buy TFT and then switch to CHI. There are no CHI minted !!! The price of TFT and CHI will change over time.</p>
<p>(***) The exchange rate between CHI and TFT is defined regularly by the DAO to be market conform. We start with 1 CHI = 2 TFT.</p>

<p>There is a DEFI and Auction system built into the FreeFlow Chain which allows everyone to buy and sell their CHI and FFKs.</p>
<h2 id="defi"><a class="header" href="#defi">DEFI</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity pool assets provided in CHI, FFK's, TFT and chosen stable coin e.g. USDC.</li>
<li>The liquidity pool is managed by a DAO and the Buy/Sales prices and used DEFI algorithms for the different currency pairs are defined on a regular basis.</li>
<li>The difference between sales and buy is called the spread and is 100% to the benefit to the Liquidity Pool providers, this means it can be very rewarding to provide liquidity to such a pool.</li>
<li>At start the DEFI system is very simple and will mainly be geared towards people buying their CHI's.</li>
<li>Everyone (also the FF Treasury) can withdraw and fund their assets (digital currencies or tokens) to the pool.</li>
<li>The pool is a very fair mechanism (more fair compared to the current AMM based liquidity pools in our opinion). The prices and used algorithms are always known in advance and everyone can go in/out whenever they want. Their reward is always in line to their participation per every transaction which happened at that specific time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auction-system-q2-2023"><a class="header" href="#auction-system-q2-2023">Auction System (Q2 2023)</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>once every period (probably every week or 2 weeks), people can leave their bids with the Auction system.</li>
<li>the auction system will use predefined rules on how the exchanges will happen. A possible algorithm could be Dutch auction but it's possible that other algorithms can be implemented as well.</li>

<p>We believe the above methods are more safe and fair for all participants in the FreeFlow Ecosystem as such we did not choose yet to support AMM (Automatic MarketMaking) or OrderBook based trading as typically found on many blockchains.</p>
<p>We chose to disadvantage liquidity in line to valuation protection as we believe longer term this is more beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Of course we are a decentralized organization and as such we might together define to change these rules.</p>

<p>A FFK is your key which gives access to a FreeFlow Twin.</p>
<p>You need one to benefit from all the FreeFlow experiences (now and in the future).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>The value of a digital life today per year is +10.000 USD (as estimated by some marketing companies) but in reality it's much higher, FreeFlow DAO is selling 1m FreeFlow Keys at 200 to 60 USD per FreeFlow key for a lifetime.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>By having an FreeFlow Key you get following direct benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>All skills and experiences as mentioned in this document.
<ul>
<li>Many more experiences being built, we will have everything required to allow you to have a safe &amp; private internet experience as complete as everything you have access to today.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access to endless amounts of information free of charge (education, knowledge).</li>
<li>The ability to exchange anything for everything (money to money, money to service, money to goods, …) directly from supplier to buyer. This gives you at least 3x more buying power compared to today.</li>
<li>Ability to keep your data safe for ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of this is huge, there are 2 ways how to get to an FreeFlow Key</p>
<ul>
<li>You can rent a FreeFlow Key: 5 USD worth of CHI per month (not possible yet)</li>
<li>You can buy a FreeFlow Key: 200-60 USD worth of CHI, lifetime valid</li>
</ul>

<p>FFK are digital assets as stored on the Algorand blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="tokenomics"><a class="header" href="#tokenomics">Tokenomics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are only 1.000.000 FFK's in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>FFKs are the alternative to a license fee for having access to technology
<ul>
<li>30% of the sales goes to ThreeFold (see www.threefold.io) to keep on further creation of the tech.</li>
<li>70% goes to the FreeFlow Treasury of the FreeFlow DAO which will use to fund the growth of ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FFK's can only be bought by <a href="network/tokens/chi.html">CHI's</a>, see <a href="network/tokens/../buy/buy_my_twin.html">here</a></li>
<li>CHI's can only be farmed or bought with TFT (the utility token of ThreeFold).</li>
<li>FFKs can be rented from the Freeflow DAO or any FFK holder at a to be defined price (prob around 5 USD per month). </li>
<li>If there are not enough FFK available for rent, then the DAO can create FFK's for rental only purpose and owned by treasury.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relation-to-chi"><a class="header" href="#relation-to-chi">Relation to CHI</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Price of CHI at start is 0.1 USD. CHI is the utility token of freeflow and represents Internet Capacity on the ThreeFold grid. CHI is created by <a href="network/tokens/../farming/farming_intro.html">FreeFlow Farmers</a>. You can buy CHI from the Algorand Blockchain. Be aware that the price per FFK in CHI will be variable over time as CHI price changes in USD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each CHI links into the ThreeFold Token called TFT, at this stage the currency exchange rate is 0.5 CHI corresponds to 1 TFT. Every TFT holder can exchange their TFT for CHI at this rate, or the other way around. ThreeFold is the capacity layer on top of which FreeFlow has been built.</p>
<h2 id="internet-resources-available-for-a-ffk-enabled-twin"><a class="header" href="#internet-resources-available-for-a-ffk-enabled-twin">Internet Resources Available for a FFK Enabled Twin</a></h2>
<p>A FreeFlow Twin linked to a FFK has following default resources available for the first 1 year: 0.1 CU and 0.1 SU. All additional resources used or after the first year the twin owner has to use his/her CHI to pay the energy fees (storage, compute and network). All the capabilities are for free for ever and all upgrades as developed by FF will remain free of charge as well.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chi"><a class="header" href="#chi">CHI</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/tfgrid/farming/threefold__grid_new_.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>CHI is the FreeFlow utility token which is used to reward farmers for making compute, network and storage capacity available as well as to allow users to buy this resource from the FF Network. All of this is being arranged and tracked by the FreeFlow Blockchain called FFChain.</p>
<p>FreeFlow is running as a side chain to ThreeFold and CHI tokens can be exchanged between ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) and CHI.</p>
<h2 id="chi-is-scarce"><a class="header" href="#chi-is-scarce">CHI is scarce</a></h2>
<p>At start FF sells 5,000 nodes extra (extra compared to existing capacity of ThreeFold grid).</p>
<ul>
<li>5.000 nodes results in 100-150.000.000 CHI over 5 years.</li>
<li>5.000 nodes enable +- 250.000 to 500.000 users with their digital life.</li>
<li>Each user renting a twin needs about 50 CHI per month to do so, this results in the requirement of 300.000.000 CHI per year (if they would hold it per year).</li>
<li>1m users buying FFK's (the twins) at these conditions, results in +-1.000.000.000 CHI.</li>
<li>Clearly there are not enough CHI's which means the CHI price needs to go up as the network grows to compensetate for this requirement.</li>
<li>As more nodes are added to the network, the more CHI is needed the CHI price will have to go up to compensate for the extra demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="farming-reward-calculation-details"><a class="header" href="#farming-reward-calculation-details">Farming Reward Calculation Details</a></h2>
<p>Each FreeFlow node has a certain amount of compute, storage and network resources.</p>

<li>Compute Capacity (CPU)</li>
<li>Memory Capacity (RAM)</li>
<li>Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)</li>
<li>Network Capacity (Bandwidth, IP Addresses)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reward is calculated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TFT earned per month = 
CU farmed * CU farming rewards 
+ SU farmed * SU farming rewards
+ NU used * NU farming rewards
+ IPAddr used * IPAddr farming rewards</p>

<p>For the predefined nodes as defined on the &quot;buy node&quot; page the rewards are fixed and described in this manual and expressed in CHI but pegged to USD.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The rewards get expressed in CHI but are pegged to the USD and registered in the FreeFlow Blockchain (FFChain) at FreeFlow Node registration time in USD. If the CHI vs USD price changes then the amount of CHI will be adjusted in relation to the USD price.</li>
<li>Rewards are calculated from Resource Units,  see below.</li>
<li>Rewards for NU and IP Addresses are dynamic
The FFChain tracks capacity utilization and as such the reward can be calculated for the Farmer.</li>
<li>All Internet capacity farmed is rewarded on a monthly basis but only unlocked after 6 months, in case the farmer removes the node before 5 years the last 6 months of farmed tokens will not be released to farmer but to FreeFlow Treasury.</li>
<li>Minimum SLA = Service Level Agreement needs to be achieved before CHI can be rewarded.</li>
<li>The FreeFlow DAO can decide to change the rewards and needs community majority vote for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  Zero-OS and FFChain software translates resource units (CRU, MRU, HRU, SRU) into cloud units (CU, SU) for farming reward calculation.</p>
<h4 id="compute"><a class="header" href="#compute">Compute</a></h4>
<p>For farming, 1 CU equals:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 virtual CPUs with a maximum over subscription of 4 CPUs and minimum required memory of 4GB. </li>
<li>An over subscription of 4 CPUs remains still gentle as we understand many other providers use more.</li>
<li>There needs to be at least 50GB SSD per CU, if not there is penalty for nr of CU, reasoning is that otherwise people cannot deploy their VM's or Containers if there would not be minimal SSD.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">cu = min((mru - 1) / 4, cru * 4 / 2, sru / 50)

<li>1 GB of memory is subtracted for the operating system to function.</li>
<li>please note minimal passmark per CU (with 4GB mem), needs to be 1500 passmark, this is not being checked today but might be done in future. If your chosen CPU has less than 1000 passmark per CU (of 4 GB mem), it could be your final CU's will be lower once that feature is introduced.</li>

<h2 id="important-chi-utilization-remarks"><a class="header" href="#important-chi-utilization-remarks">Important CHI Utilization Remarks</a></h2>
<p>CHI's are needed to use the Internet Capacity as farmed in the FreeFlow Network.</p>
<p>The price for CU,SU and NU capacity is defined by the FreeFlow DAO.</p>
<p>The CHI's used for utilization are distributed as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>10% to FreeFlow Validators</li>
<li>10% to ThreeFold Foundation</li>
<li>35% gets burned (this is the minimal burn)</li>
<li>45% to the FreeFlow DAO Treasury (which can decide to burn or use for promotion or FF network development purposes). DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>For deploying the FreeFlow Twin's CU/SU and NU resources are required, the FreeFlow Chain will arrange this energy (CHI) flow in line with above specifications.</p>

<p><img src="theinternet/img/theinternet.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer networks</a> that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. </p>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, cabling or radio links, repeaters, modems etc. An Internet Protocol address (IP address), a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network, enables us to the Internet Protocol for communication and store/run data on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Internet carries many applications and services, most prominently the World Wide Web, including social media, e-mail, mobile applications, multiplayer online games, Internet telephony (calls), file sharing, and streaming media services.</p>
<p>Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in centralized data centers owned by a few large corporations. This centralized model is inefficient, as through it's centralized model, if the main servers go down, the whole system experiences downtime. Hundreds of downtime events have been recorded throughout the last few years. Also, given these companies own the data centers, they also own the data that is contained in them and use it for profit reasons. </p>

<p>More than 500 undersea cables and thousands more terrestrial networks connect us all together digitally. These cables carry our data between server and recipient. While satellites also play a role in connectivity, without cables it's safe to say the global Internet would not be what it is today.</p>

<h1 id="the-internet-data-centers"><a class="header" href="#the-internet-data-centers">The Internet Data Centers</a></h1>
<p>Today the Internet is mainly delivered out of data centers, which are huge facilities containing up to millions of servers. They centralize shared IT operations and equipment for the purposes of storing, processing, and disseminating data and applications. Data centers have become a foundational necessity of today's Internet, but there are several significant issues with them:</p>
<h2 id="centralization"><a class="header" href="#centralization">Centralization</a></h2>
<p>The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute and storage (and network) infrastructures. Also, this global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China. This means that most of today's Internet is out of reach of billions of people in developing nations particularly in South America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</p>
<h2 id="cost"><a class="header" href="#cost">Cost</a></h2>
<p>It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyperscale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients. To meet the projected growth of the Internet in 2022, $5 trillion would have to be invested with this model</p>
<h2 id="energy-consumption"><a class="header" href="#energy-consumption">Energy Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage and consume around 205 TWh - More than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.</p>
<h2 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h2>
<p>The current IT stack depends on human error and it has been considered as the major cause of cybersecurity breaches with more than 95% of the cases. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information</p>
<h2 id="cannot-support-future-demand"><a class="header" href="#cannot-support-future-demand">Cannot Support Future Demand</a></h2>
<p>To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will be needed to build and consume an additional 400 GW/h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.</p>

<p><img src="theinternet/img/internet_bandwidth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Internet today is constructed in a centralized way. The hyperscale data centers that form the backbone of the Internet's infrastructure play a massive role in our digital lives, and they are often located far from users, particularly those living in developing countries or regions. Each time we take an online action such as posting a photo or sending a message, the data is transmitted from our device to that centralized data center, and to the person or persons on the other end. So, you can begin to see how proximity to these servers plays a role in the end user experience.</p>
<p>Internet bandwidth refers to the amount of information or data that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for speed, but they are not the same. Whereas bandwidth is how much information you receive in a given time, speed is how fast that information is received.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of filling a swimming pool with water. If the hose has a wide circumference, more water can flow than if the hose were narrow. In this instance, water is the bandwidth and the rate at which the water flows is the speed.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into both bandwidth and speed. An end-to-end network path usually consists of multiple connections, each with different bandwidth capacity. And the link with the lowest bandwidth can limit the overall capacity of all connections in the path. When data travels shorter distances, this is less of a factor. Network congestion (usage) is also a major factor. And it's pretty clear to see how by traveling long distances, this would become a bigger problem.</p>
