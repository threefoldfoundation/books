<ul>
<li>you are  in full control and all data belongs to you.</li>
<li>your digital life only needs 1 watt of energy (which is nothing)</li>
<li>you can communicate with everyone everywhere without worries</li>

<p>Everything is structured as client-server model</p>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/everything_client_server.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The servers run as applications inside huge datacenters using a lot of energy</li>
<li>Most of the processes in those servers are being repeated = highly inefficient</li>
<li>We exist 100x times, very inefficient</li>
<li>This leads to a lot of centralization -&gt; insecure, as well as abuse of our data</li>
<li>This has also been called Web 1.0 and Web 2.0</li>

<h3 id="blockchain-based-web-30-vision"><a class="header" href="#blockchain-based-web-30-vision">Blockchain Based Web 3.0 Vision</a></h3>
<p>Blockchain decentralized the server, but in principle it remains a client - server model</p>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/blockchain_is_clientserver.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>It is definitely a step in the right direction but the paradigm is the same</li>
<li>We as users still exist in different systems, and have to deal with different applications (protocols)</li>
<li>These blockchains can be integrated, and through Web 2.0 concepts the web application can interact with multiple blockchains at the same time</li>
<li>This has also been called Web 3.0</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/blockchain_based_distr_computer.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The browser has now become our operating system running on javascript. All applications run in our browser and interact with multiple blockchains.</p>

<p>Our web4 Digital Twin architecture puts the user central. The Digital Twin is a special mode of our TF Executor concept.</p>
<p>Each user has a private secure executor running which we call a digital twin.</p>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/digital_twin_to_browser.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Every user uses any browser to access their digital twin. Our TFCONNECT makes sure that the connection is secure.</p>
<p>The secure browser engine runs on the TFGrid close to where your Twin is.</p>
<p>This takes care of a very secure approach and unlimited scalability.</p>
<p><img src="web4/architecture_highlevel/img/twin_capabilities_.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The twin has basic capabilities which are strongly version controlled, but contributions from the global community are more than welcome.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a system which is simply good enough for any possible experience.</p>
<p>Rather than survival of the fittest, we believe in a system of collaboration, where we invite everyone to make the system better so it fits us all. We don't need three chat systems, we need one which is usable by thousands of experiences.</p>
<p>Developers create Experiences on top, not apps. Experiences re-use the same capabilities.</p>
<p>This has huge benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>10x less engineering effort needed per experience</li>
<li>more sustainable (less energy loss)</li>
<li>easier for user, no duplication</li>
<li>more simplicy</li>
<li>more powerful</li>

<p>Ultra Scalable &amp; Secure Decentralized Deployment</p>
<p><strong>Example deployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lots of locations (offices, banks, small datacenters, universities, ...), each providing compute &amp; storage to a private and/or public grid by means of the 3Nodes</li>
<li>Each node runs Zero-OS which has no shell and cannot be accessed by any person in the organization (bank, government, enterprise)</li>
<li>None of the nodes has enough data to allow anyone to reconstruct the data</li>
<li>The different nodes together deliver a super resilient network of compute &amp; network resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Even if, in a disaster scenario, 30% of the locations would go down, the system would still function and be available to its users. This is the most reliable deployment possible in IT landscape today.</strong></p>
<p>What runs on the 3Nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain Nodes</li>
<li>The distributed storage system (ultra safe, zero-knowledge proof)</li>
<li>Digital Twins for users</li>
<li>Secure Browser Engines (can be in ultra safe location)</li>
<li>Stateless high security (e.g. financial) apps</li>

<p>Existing blockchains don’t have a pruning feature, which means old data cannot get archived, this leads to very large blockchains rather quickly. We have developed a technology which can enable any chosen blockchain and allow old data to be parked on the Quantum Safe Storage system (means can never be corrupted or lost). It means only active data remain on the online chain, this allows for much more scalability and better utilization of the hardware.</p>
<p>To do effective pruning we need to modify parts of the chosen blockchain, but we know how to do this.</p>

<p><img src="web4/finance/img/cryptocurrency.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>In Addition to allowing a user to directly integrate with an outside digital currency, we also suggest allowing wrapping of the outside currencies e.g. a wrapped BitCoin (BTC).</p>
<p>This Wrapped BTC is then stored on the main or dedicated digital currency chain (can even be one chain per wrapped asset). The IBC (see below) allows the wrapped BTC to be used by the user from their wallet and digital twin.</p>
<p>The Original BTC is stored offline in the Knox Security Vault using our Quantum Safe Storage Codec. This allows for ultimate security and flexibility for users.</p>
<p>The bank can choose to allow users to exchange digital currencies with the external world or not, through IBC (Inter Blockchain Protocol, see below), this can be easily achieved. The bank can even choose to become a liquidity provider for the existing digital currency world (optional).</p>
<p>Revolut, for example, has chosen to keep the digital currencies in their internal system, and the user can only exchange from their own fiat currency to the digital currency and back. We believe though that it's nicer to allow the user to exchange digital currencies with the outside world if it matches the Bank’s Regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>It is possible to introduce multiple stages e.g. in the digital bank ecosystem, users can freely exchange currencies with each other (stays on chain). Once they want to go off chain, extra checks are done to make sure there is no fraud involved, it can then take a certain time before it executes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TODO: (sacha)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof of Authenticity (PoA) is an algorithm that allows peers to verify that people, products and statements on the ThreeFold Grid are genuine. It acts as a reputation engine to find information on the grid. </p>
<h2 id="why-proof-of-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#why-proof-of-authenticity">Why Proof of Authenticity</a></h2>
<p>The ThreeFold Grid is a decentralized internet infrastructure that can contain a vast amount of information. It will be valuable to it's users according to the reliability of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The people they connect with;</li>
<li>The products and services they access;</li>
<li>The information they consume.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to automate information search in a decentralized and trustful environemnt, an algorithm that is able to scale information verification in a neutral way is required. </p>
<p>Proof of authenticity puts forward a very simple method to verify the genuiness of information on the ThreeFold Grid as well as it's participants. </p>
<p>Here's an example of how PoA works in a decentralized context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone fills in their profile with their personal and professional data. </li>
<li>A former colleague finds their information and verifies their information as being authentic. </li>
<li>Once a user gets verified e.g. 10 times, they can be trusted to be real and genuine. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above can also apply to products, statements and more. In that sense, PoA can solve multiple digital challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The verifiability of information and news </li>
<li>A non-biased way to rate products and services. </li>
<li>website authenticity </li>
<li>etc.</li>

<p>Each Knox Security Vault is an ultra safe area. Thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage system, it is not possible to retrieve a key even if a hacker would be in one safe, as a combination of three safes is required to recover information.</p>
<p>We suggest using the key storage in the following way: each wallet from a user stores the encrypted dispersed key distributed over four or five Knox Security Vaults. Only in the case of a disaster and user strong identification, an user could get access (in the case of death of the customer, to hand-over to the relatives).</p>

<p>To allow web4 to work we need a reliable cloud layer, which is a layer capable to execute all workloads as described in this document in a safe and a reliable way.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os"><a class="header" href="#ultra-secure-operating-system--zero-os">Ultra Secure Operating System = Zero-OS</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Zero-OS is a lightweight and efficient operating system. There is no shell, local nor remote. It supports a small number of primitives; the low-level functions it could perform natively in the operating system. Zero-OS (ZOS) is the operating system which allows the 3Nodes to be used to provide IT capacity in all safety to its applications. ZOS has been developed by ThreeFold from scratch, starting from the Linux kernel with the purpose to improve on efficiency, energy usage, performance, scale, cost of management and security. All applications, twins and blockchains are secured by the Zero-OS operating system.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h3>
<p>Most centrally managed operating systems rely on human management and intervention, which leads to downtime and security issues.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the Internet, the development of operating systems mostly arises through the addition of further layers of code to improve capabilities and functionalities of software, this leads to too much complexity, performance loss, and energy usage issues.</p>
<p>To build a truly scalable, private and efficient Internet infrastructure, we had to start from scratch to ensure a minimal hacking surface, improve efficiency, and ensure that anyone who connects hardware to the ThreeFold Grid wouldn’t be able to access the private user data thanks to our Quantum Safe Storage System.</p>
<p>The result is game-changing as ZOS is able to provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless: without shell, local or remote, it does not allow for inbound network connections to happen nor can data be fetched by node operators.</li>
<li>Lightweight: Zero-OS can save up-to 10X energy on storage workloads.</li>
<li>Autonomous: it runs by itself and doesn’t require humans to maintain it, removing human error and considerably reducing the hacking surface.</li>
<li>Decentralized: deploy IT workloads and infrastructures in a private and neutral environment.</li>
<li>Secure: store workloads in a quantum safe (future proof) way.</li>
<li>Private: communicate end-to-end without centralized servers or APIs in the middle.</li>
<li>Compatible: run anything that can run on Linux but in a decentralized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="web4/zos/img/zero_os_server.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>Imagine an operating system with the following benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Upto 10x more efficient for certain workloads (e.g. storage)</li>
<li>No installation required</li>
<li>All files are deduplicated for the VM’s, containers and the ZOS itself, no more data duplicated filesystems</li>
<li>The hacking footprint is super small, which leads to much more safe systems</li>
<li>Every file is fingerprinted and gets checked at launch time of an application</li>
<li>There is no shell or server interface on the operating system</li>
<li>The networks are end2end encrypted between all Nodes</li>
<li>There is the possibility to completely disconnect the compute/storage from the network service part which means hackers have a lot less chance to get to the data.</li>
<li>A smart contract for IT layer allows groups of people to deploy IT workloads with concensus and full control</li>
<li>All workloads which can run on linux, can run on Zero-OS but in a much more controlled, private and safe way</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="web4/storage/img/quantum_safe_storage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Imagine a storage system with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>upto 10x more efficient (power and usage of hardware)</li>
<li>ultra reliable, data can not be lost</li>
<li>ultra safe &amp; private</li>
<li>ultra scalable</li>
<li>sovereign, data is close to you in the country of your choice</li>
<li>true Peer To Peer, by everyone for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not a dream, it does already exist, and is the underpinning of the ultra safe <strong>Cloud &amp; Internet Backend System</strong> empowering this solution.</p>
<p>Our storage architecture follows the true Peer To Peer design. Any participating nodes (can be on ultra safe locations) only store small incomplete parts of data (files, photos, movies, databases…) by only offering a slice of their current (local) storage devices. Managing the storage and retrieval of all these ‘distributed fragments’ is done by a software that creates ‘development and/or end-user interfaces’ for this storage algorithm. We call this ‘dispersed storage‘.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="quantum-safe-twin-storage-system"><a class="header" href="#quantum-safe-twin-storage-system">Quantum Safe Twin Storage System</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/storage/img/qss_twin.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Each Twin or Executor stores the data on a quantum safe filesystem, which means data can never be lost, any application just sees a normal filesystem so it's compatible with any application.</p>
<p>This is an ultra scalable design, there are no limits to the size which can be achieved.</p>
<p>This is a ‘zero knowledge’ proof system which means that, once the data leaves the twin it is impossible for any hacker or even quantum computer to get access or to modify the data, there is simply not enough information available.</p>
<p>A redundant filesystem can store PB’s (millions of gigabytes) of information.</p>
<p>Unique features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited scalable (many petabytes) filesystem</li>
<li>Quantum Safe: even if used on the ThreeFold Grid, no farmer knows what the data is about</li>
<li>Even a quantum computer cannot decrypt</li>
<li>Data can’t be lost</li>
<li>Protection for datarot, data will auto repair</li>
<li>Data is kept forever</li>
<li>Data is dispersed over multiple sites</li>
<li>Sites can go down, data not lost</li>
<li>Up to 10x more efficient than storing on classic storage cloud systems</li>
<li>Can be mounted as a filesystem on any OS or any deployment system (OSX, Linux, Windows, Docker, Kubernetes, ThreeFold Grid, …)</li>
<li>Compatible with ± all data workloads (not high performance data driven workloads like a database)</li>
<li>Self-healing: when a node or disk is lost, storage system can get back to the original redundancy level</li>
<li>Helps with compliance to regulations like GDPR (as the hosting facility has no view on what is stored, information is encrypted and incomplete)</li>
<li>Hybrid: can be installed onsite, public, private, …</li>

<p>The planetary network leads to serious benefits in scalability, reliability and security:</p>

<p>Security is a super important element of web 4.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="secure-access-mechanism--browser-firewall"><a class="header" href="#secure-access-mechanism--browser-firewall">Secure Access Mechanism = Browser Firewall</a></h1>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/browser_firewall.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>For ultra secure use cases, the user doesn't use javascript in his browser, he connects over an ultra secure end2end encrypted and multi authenticated link from his browser to a secure location. In the secure location, the secure browser engine gives access to the required web and banking applications which connect further.</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/twin_functions.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>As an option, the web cessions can be recorded for auditing or anti-hacking/fraud detection, also in a secure location.</p>
<p>The twin can communicate with other twins, in a close ultra secure context, giving no chance to hackers to interfere. The data is stored on a Quantum Safe Storage system (see further).</p>
<p><img src="web4/security/img/cyber_security.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>This leads to very good protection and ‘Auditing’ opportunities.</p>
<p>Cyber crime will have a much harder time to be successful, way more difficult (we hope impossible).</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event a hacker would succeed, he would only interfere with one twin, which means only one customer would be affected!!!  This makes it so much harder for hackers to deploy capital to hack and social engineer their way into a secure environment.</p>
