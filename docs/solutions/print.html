<p>There are three critical issues that we have identified in the current internet that we believe must be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a cyberpandemic going on, with cyber crime growing exponentially.</li>
<li>For many countries, the internet is GDP negative and controlled by foriegn powers.</li>
<li>The proposed solution of Central Bank Digital Currencies is actually flawed and must be carefully managed.</li>

<p><img src="solutions/img/cybersecurity_trillion.png" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<p>Countries have a hard time defending themselves against cyber security threats; the main issue is that the technology available to them often comes from compromised sources. Where better to put backdoors than in the tools which should defend you? As such, we now have an IT infrastructure which is rife with issues and which is incredibly difficult to make secure.</p>
<p>EXISTING SOLUTIONS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND OUTDATED.
A NEW APPROACH IS NEEDED.</p>

<h3 id="data-privacy--sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#data-privacy--sovereignty">Data Privacy &amp; Sovereignty</a></h3>
<p>Almost all data of a country's internet users is not hosted on that country's soil. This leads to a loss of sovereignity and poses serious data risks to the citizens of your country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who’s ever cleared a browser history feels like technology throws us back at ourselves. My Google data, combined with my bank card transactions, social media messages, health records, and more, could tell you more about me than I could. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Most of us don’t have the time or energy to keep track of all the data we’re shedding online, or read all the terms and conditions when downloading an app. (Ten years ago, two researchers at Carnegie Mellon found it would take the average internet user 25 days per year to read every privacy policy on every website they visited. Today, that number will only have increased) We are now in a position where we have to trust that regulators and industry leaders are keeping us safe.</em></p>
<p><em>But policy makers are struggling to keep up with the pace of technological advances. The number of devices collecting and analyzing information in real time, otherwise known as the internet of things, is expected to exceed 50 billion by 2020.</em></p>
<p><em>Recent, high-profile data breaches, such as Uber’s loss of 57 million users’ information, and political firm Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of Facebook data relating to nearly 90 million users, show even when we think we’re being careful online, we’re not always safe from harm.</em></p>
<h3 id="for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative"><a class="header" href="#for-most-countries-the-internet-is-gdp-negative">For Most Countries The Internet is GDP Negative</a></h3>
<p>Internet DATA is more important than voice (minutes) these days, the main communication of the future is through data, new regulations and technical guidelines are required to secure this future trend.</p>
<p>Most of the revenue related to internet and telecommunications services does not stay in your country and as such the internet is GDP negative. We believe that by means of practical technology and regulatory guidelines, this trend can be reversed. The value of a digital life in the US is thousands of USD per year per person; imagine the potential for your country.</p>
<h3 id="internet-is-too-centralized"><a class="header" href="#internet-is-too-centralized">Internet is too centralized</a></h3>
<p><img src="solutions/img/centralized_dc_issues.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Too few individuals control access to the internet, leading to unjust pricing and security risks. It's too easy for hackers to focus on the few parties delivering access to the rest of us. More decentralization will lead to more security and fairer chances for everyone involved. Ledger (blockchain) technology can be used to decentralize internet access yet still give full insight to the country's government in relation to billing &amp; utilization statistics.</p>

<p><img src="solutions/img/CBDc.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CBDC = Central Bank Digital Currencies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CBDC’s are an incredibly exciting possible innovation for a country. But, we realize that there are serious challenges and requirements not met in relation to sovereignty, security, and scalability in many of the current project proposals.</p>
<p>This is not only for CBDC’s, but blockchain technology in general.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that this does not happen for your country. We want to make sure your country maintains control over your money supply. Right now, in some deployments, we see that this is a real risk and countries could lose control to other countries or hackers.</p>
<p>Buying into a technology from a vendor which does not apply to following requirements is discouraged</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the blockchain needs to be in the country (nodes, technology, knowledge, …)</li>
<li>The source code of the blockchain technology needs to be understood by engineers and developers living and working in your country and working for a trusted entity (or more than one)</li>
<li>The blockchain technology needs to be truly decentralized
<ul>
<li>e.g. the coders should not be able to change the blockchain operation (right now most tech companies can change their blockchains by changing the code)</li>
<li>The validator nodes cannot be hosted in datacenters out of the country or be owned by too few parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It needs to be verified that there are no backdoors in the blockchain technology.</li>
<li>Blockchain needs to be scalable enough</li>
<li>Even if internet backbone connections go down (e.g. between the country and the rest of the world), the blockchain should keep on working.</li>
<li>Blockchain should be energy efficient and not based on burning fossil fuels or, more generally, high energy consumption.</li>
<li>There need to be procedures to allow the legal system of your country to interfere in case serious issues arise.</li>
<li>There needs to be a mechanism for people to manage their identity and private keys with more user friendliness (today it's too complicated and too dangerous).</li>
<li>Running blockchain permissioned (which means managed by people in centralized datacenters) might bring the risk of running a money chain related to a couple of people who need to be trusted, this might even be less regulated than in a typical central banking environment.</li>

<p><em>Albert Einstein : &quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We believe that in the current technology ecosystem, a lot of solutions are like painkillers, they layer a quick fix on a broken system. We need real solutions which go back to the root of the problem.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="private-quantum-safe-digital-backbone"><a class="header" href="#private-quantum-safe-digital-backbone">PRIVATE QUANTUM-SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-antidote-for-the-cyberpandemic"><a class="header" href="#the-antidote-for-the-cyberpandemic">THE ANTIDOTE FOR THE CYBERPANDEMIC</a></h2>
<p><img src="solutions/img/cyberpandemic_fix.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A private intranet digital backbone built with a very different approach can solve the wave of cybercrime that the internet is experiencing today.</p>
<p><strong>This multi-trillion USD problem</strong> will not go away by itself. we have a multitude of technology solutions at our disposal which are able to provide a real antidote for the cyberpandemic. This antidote is not a &quot;layered on&quot; painkiller quick fix, but a from-the-ground-up re-engineered, effective and breakthrough solution.</p>
<p>Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>A liquid cooled, edge distributed, decentralized network of small datacenter nodes (they can be in basements or other hidden locations). Through decentralization, we can achieve the redundacy necessary to maintain access to critical services and data at any point in time. Each location can be as small as one cubic meter. </li>
<li>Provide a quantum safe storage system, make sure data can never get corrupted, lost or stolen. Not even a quantum computer can hack into it. This is also an ultra scalable system.</li>
<li>A country-owned multilayer network communication encryption system for the government and other collaborators.</li>
<li>Fortify your existing web (and other) applications, to not allow access over default browsers, a standard browser is a huge security risk and needs to be avoided. We can sandbox the access and hosting of these apps.</li>
<li>Use blockchain technology (BUT within the country) deployed in a decentralized way by local teams, which do not rely on public blockchain technology or technology which might be compromised or controlled too much by coders outside of the country. This can be used for CBDCs.</li>
<li>Block backdoors (vulnerabilities as used by hackers) to communicate to the internet, not by means of firewalls (proven not to work), but by means of a very different approach (not available publicly today).</li>
</ul>
<p>The more expensive solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ultra private secondary meshed wireless network which will stay up and running even in the harshest conditions (war, natural disasters). This secondary network would be compatible with 4G devices, where only authorized people can gain access, End2End encrypted and not interconnected with ANY existing telecom or internet infrastructure. Many paths between all endpoints mean extreme resilience to all attacks and disasters.</li>
<li>Quantum Safe Network (expensive but doable, not even a future quantum computer will be able to hack such a network). Data packets are cut into chunks of information which cannot be intercepted by anyone or brought back together in a way it would make sense to assemble, not even by a quantum computer.</li>
<li>A communication mechanism which does not use TCP-IP (the internet protocol). The use of FPGA-based network processors allows for deployment of neutral sovereign network equipment. The FPGA components are programmable and understood by teams within the country. Because no TCP-IP is being used, backdoors have are less probable and it becomes much more complicated for hackers to succeed. This is expensive though but, in our opinion, worth it. This fulfils the crucial need for sovereignty.</li>
<li>All critical software used should be owned by local experts within the country and it all needs to be opensource. This is the only way to minimise backdoors and to keep things simple and integrated.</li>
<li>Local experts need to be able to improve, deploy and integrate all technologies used in country.</li>
<li>All components required need to be in stock in the country and assembly should occur within the country.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Your Internet needs to become GDP Positive</strong></p>
<p>There needs to be a decentralized but ultra sovereign <a href="solutions//ourinternet/ourledger/ourledger.html">digital backbone</a> which can deliver on the following requirements. This is for all citizens in the country (unlike as described in the previous section).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All data stays in the country</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All users have a unique strongly authenticated identity (using novel mechanisms like proof of authenticity by means of peer review, which is much stronger compared to classic KYC/AML). This identity needs to be unique on a national scale and be usable for all digital services of the government as well as the private sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All critical data is stored on a quantum safe storage system with the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data should never be lost.</li>
<li>Data should never be corrupted.</li>
<li>The storage system used needs to self heal in case of disaster or corruption.</li>
<li>All history should stay intact and data should not be modified.</li>
<li>Security should go beyond encryption technology as it is NOT enough. Security needs to be quantum safe.</li>
<li>The system needs to be ultra scalable, support tens of millions of users and be scaleable to at least 1000 petabytes in order to be ready for the future.</li>
<li>Reliability policy needs to be configurable, so the data provider/user can decide the level of protection (redundancy) desired.</li>
<li>Even if the main datacenters go down, the data should stay intact, uncorrupted and online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be flexible, which means usable for all required digital services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly decentralized</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-owned by the private sector and government institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The backbone needs to be truly sovereign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered by local teams operating within the country (living &amp; working)</li>
<li>Guided by a non corruptible entity (not for profit might be a good idea) as a supervising entity.</li>
<li>All source code must be open (open source)</li>
<li>Enough technically skilled people in the country to work &amp; understand this code.</li>
<li>The code must have limitless usability and there can't be hidden costs (licenses, …) </li>
<li>The country must be able to improve and develop the country from within its borders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical data means</p>
<ul>
<li>All billing records.</li>
<li>Identity.</li>
<li>Utilization records.</li>
<li>Government information.</li>
<li>Government archives.</li>
<li>… to be further defined …</li>

<p>Internet &amp; datacenter services need to contribute to the GDP of Country. Today the internet costs more money than it brings for most countries. By using a better digital system and new regulations, a country can greatly improve its revenue collection.</p>

<p>We have our own 5G capable technology available which can be made part of the INCA project model. This would allows thousands if not millions of users to co-own their own telecom infrastructure to give them access to their future digital life.</p>

<p>Deliver solutions which cost less than what is available today and provide more inclusion; millions of people don’t have access to decent healthcare or education and this will improve that situation. Digital future technology has the capacity to make that happen. It is super important that this technology stays in line with the above requirements.</p>
<h3 id="digital-future-life"><a class="header" href="#digital-future-life">Digital Future Life</a></h3>
<p>Allow everyone in the country to participate in a more inclusive and  GDP-positive internet experience. There are a vast number of projects which fit this category, but it's all about providing a sovereign digital future for all the citizens of a country.</p>

<p>The upgraded sovereign internet digital backbone needs to be able to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital national identity management infrastructure.</li>
<li>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).</li>
<li>Voting and other government services.</li>
<li>Government collaboration system with far stronger security and data privacy measures.</li>
<li>Education (deliver cost effective but capable education for everyone)</li>
<li>Healthcare (medical records, global scalable healthcare for everyone)</li>
<li>Mining industry (fairer redistribution for a country's natural resources)</li>
<li>Land bank (registry for all land)</li>
<li>Transparent revenue collection</li>
<li>Port authorities (avoid fraud)</li>
</ul>

<p>Without going into detail national cyber security is becoming a major topic of the future. See what happened with Ukraine, the first Russian attack eliminated their core digital backbone and datacenters.</p>
<p>We believe the government needs to get a sovereign system where only open source components are used, which are understood by technical teams with a deep level of expertise on those components.</p>
<p>Some ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Highly secure phones running non Google or Apple operating systems.</li>
<li>Compute equipment in liquid cooled nodes, ie <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg80856/html/CHRG-112hhrg80856.htm">EMP</a>-safe.</li>
<li>Collaboration systems use fully decentralized but end2end encrypted infrastructure.</li>
<li>Strong authentication.</li>
<li>Entry points are in super safe but stateless environments, this means even if the entry points get lost, data is never lost.</li>
<li>Data storage is quantum safe.</li>
<li>Browsers CANNOT run Javascript in the browser on the computer (they need to use a virtual browser in a secure vault environment).</li>
</ul>
<p>This system can be integrated in the sovereign and public internet, or as part of the more expensive but highly secure and reliable <a href="solutions/solution_cyberpandemic.html">PRIVATE QUANTUM SAFE DIGITAL BACKBONE</a>.</p>

<p><img src="solutions/img/cbdcfix.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies are a great solution to provide a better money system for your citizens.</p>
<p>Thanks to the methodology and technology we have available we can provide a country with a solution which is </p>
<ul>
<li>More secure</li>
<li>Can survive Internet Downtime</li>
<li>Understood and Maintained in The Country (no dependencies on nodes out of country or expertise)</li>
</ul>
<p>We work together with some major blockchain (technology) providers to make this happen, but these providers agreed with our terms on how we have to help a country to maintain their sovereignty.</p>

<p><img src="ppp/img/crisis_waves.jpg" alt="image alt text" /></p>
<img src="ppp/img/planet_people_profit.png" alt="planetpeopleprofit" width="300" style="float: right"/>
<p>We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planet First</strong></li>
<li><strong>People Second</strong></li>
<li><strong>Profit As Result</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anything we do needs to improve our planet's situation (climate change, regenerative, respect resources, …) and help the people around us. As a result of doing so, we as investors of time and money will have created most value and will get the benefits from our efforts.</p>
<p>Of course being financially healthy is the first requirement.</p>
<p>We are in the forefront of a growing movement, more and more companies are being pushed by customers and stakeholders to prioritize sustainability and planet positive policies. We are not swimming against the stream, 
we are part of a group of leaders of change and making real the zeitgeist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>Together we are a movement, not just a project or company. Together we are creating the Internet of Internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>abundance based</li>
<li>unlimited knowledge</li>
<li>glocal communication and collaboration</li>
<li>exchange of value without limitations or intermediaries. </li>
</ul>
